Our objective was to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of targeting endoglin in ovarian cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Global and membranous endoglin expression was evaluated in multiple ovarian cancer lines. In vitro, the effects of siRNA-mediated endoglin knockdown with and without chemotherapy were evaluated by MTT assay, cell-cycle analysis, alkaline comet assay, gamma-H2AX foci formation, and quantitative PCR. In an orthotopic mouse model, endoglin was targeted with chitosan-encapsulated siRNA with and without carboplatin. RESULTS: Endoglin expression was surprisingly predominantly cytoplasmic, with a small population of surface-positive cells. Endoglin inhibition decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, induced double-stranded DNA damage, and increased cisplatin sensitivity. Targeting endoglin downregulates expression of numerous DNA repair genes, including BARD1, H2AFX, NBN, NTHL1, and SIRT1. BARD1 was also associated with platinum resistance, and was induced by platinum exposure. In vivo, antiendoglin treatment decreased tumor weight in both ES2 and HeyA8MDR models when compared with control (35%-41% reduction, P &lt; 0.05). Endoglin inhibition with carboplatin was associated with even greater inhibitory effect when compared with control (58%-62% reduction, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Endoglin downregulation promotes apoptosis, induces significant DNA damage through modulation of numerous DNA repair genes, and improves platinum sensitivity both in vivo and in vitro. Antiendoglin therapy would allow dual treatment of both tumor angiogenesis and a subset of aggressive tumor cells expressing endoglin and is being actively pursued as therapy in ovarian cancer.</abstract><notes>5UL1RR025777/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States&#xD;K12HD00849/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;United States&#xD;an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23147994 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1372</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1372</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Y.</author><author>Schwerbrock, N.

Antiangiogenesis therapy and chemotherapy are the two major treatment options. Unfortunately, both types of therapies when used individually have their disadvantages. Integrating antiangiogenesis therapy with chemotherapy is expected to target the tumor&apos;s vascular endothelial cells and the tumor cells simultaneously. In this study, we coformulated Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) siRNA targeting VEGFs and gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP) into a single cell-specific, targeted lipid/calcium/phosphate (LCP) nanoparticle formulation. Antitumor effect of the combination therapy using LCP loaded with both VEGF siRNA and GMP was evaluated in both subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft models of NSCLC with systemic administration. The improved therapeutic response, as compared with either VEGF siRNA or GMP therapy alone, was supported by the observation of 30-40% induction of tumor cell apoptosis, eightfold reduction of tumor cell proliferation and significant decrease of tumor microvessel density (MVD). The combination therapy led to dramatic inhibition of tumor growth, with little in vivo toxicity. In addition, the current studies demonstrated the possibility of incorporating multiple nucleic acid molecules and phosphorylated small-molecule drugs, targeting to different pathways, into a single nanoparticle formulation for profound therapeutic effect.Molecular Therapy (2013); doi:10.1038/mt.2013.120.</abstract><notes>R01 CA149363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal article&#xD;the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23774791 </url></related-urls></urls><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1377</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1377</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Y.</author><author>Kim, W.

As prodrugs, they terminate the DNA synthesis upon transforming to their active triphosphate metabolites. We have encapsulated a biologically activate nucleotide analog (i.e. gemcitabine triphosphate (GTP)), instead of the nucleoside (i.e. gemcitabine) derivative, into a novel Lipid/Calcium/Phosphate nanoparticle (LCP) platform. The therapeutic efficacy of LCP-formulated GTP was evaluated in a panel of human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and human pancreatic cancer models after systemic administrations. GTP-loaded LCPs induced cell death and arrested the cell cycle in the S phase. In vivo efficacy studies showed that intravenously injected GTP-loaded LCPs triggered effective apoptosis of tumor cells, significant reduction of tumor cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, leading to dramatic inhibition of tumor growth, with little in vivo toxicity. Broadly speaking, the current study offers preclinical proof-of-principle that many active nucleotide or phosphorylated nucleoside analogs could be encapsulated in the LCP nanoplatform and delivered systemically for a wide variety of therapeutic applications.</abstract><notes>CA149363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA149363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Netherlands</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23380359 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1387</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1387</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, M.</author><author>Xie, X.</author><author>Tang, M.</author><author>Criddle, C.

Although use of nanoparticles is promising, methods are needed for their efficient recovery post treatment. Here we address this issue by fabrication of magnetically ultraresponsive &apos;nanoscavengers&apos;, nanoparticles containing synthetic antiferromagnetic core layers and functional capping layers. When dispersed in water, the nanoscavengers efficiently interact with contaminants to remove them from the water. They are then quickly collected (&lt;5 min) with a permanent magnet, owing to their magnetically ultraresponsive core layers. Specifically, we demonstrate fabrication and deployment of Ag-capped nanoscavengers for disinfection followed by application of an external magnetic field for separation. We also develop and validate a collision-based model for pathogen inactivation, and propose a cyclical water purification scheme in which nanoscavengers are recovered and recycled for contaminant removal.</abstract><notes>R33CA138330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;England</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23673651 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1410</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1410</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zaid, T.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunolocalization of FGFR4 was conducted on 183 ovarian tumor samples. The collected FGFR4 expression data were correlated with overall survival using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. The effects of FGFR4 silencing on ovarian cancer cell growth, survival, invasiveness, apoptosis, and FGF1-mediated signaling pathway activation were evaluated by transfecting cells with FGFR4-specific siRNAs. An orthotopic mouse model was used to evaluate the effect of injection of FGFR4-specific siRNAs and FGFR4 trap protein encapsulated in nanoliposomes on ovarian tumor growth in vivo. RESULTS: Overexpression of FGFR4 protein was significantly associated with decreased overall survival durations. FGFR4 silencing significantly decreased the proliferation, survival, and invasiveness and increased apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. Also, downregulation of FGFR4 significantly abrogated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and WNT signaling pathways, which are activated by FGF1. Targeting FGFR4 with the FGFR4-specific siRNAs and FGFR4 trap protein significantly decreased ovarian tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: FGFR4 is a prognostic marker for advanced-stage, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. Silencing FGFR4 and inhibiting ligand-receptor binding significantly decrease ovarian tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that targeting ovarian cancer cells with high levels of FGFR4 protein expression is a new therapeutic modality for this disease and will improve survival of it.</abstract><notes>CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA105009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA078523/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA133057/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA133057/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;RC4 CA156551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States&#xD;an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23344261 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1401</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1401</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>You, J.</author><author>Wang, Z.</author><author>Du, Y.</author><author>Yuan, H.</author><author>Zhang, P.</author><author>Zhou, J.</author><author>Liu, F.</author><author>Li, C.</author><author>Hu, F.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, People&apos;s Republic of China. youjiandoc@zju.edu.cn</auth-address><titles><title>Specific tumor delivery of paclitaxel using glycolipid-like polymer micelles containing gold nanospheres</title><secondary-title>Biomaterials</secondary-title><alt-title>Biomaterials</alt-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomaterials</full-title><abbr-1>Biomaterials</abbr-1></periodical><alt-periodical><full-title>Biomaterials</full-title><abbr-1>Biomaterials</abbr-1></alt-periodical><pages>4510-9</pages><volume>34</volume><number>18</number><keywords><keyword>CA151668</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>Jun</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1878-5905 (Electronic)&#xD;0142-9612 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>23510855</accession-num><abstract>It is difficult for most of the drug delivery systems to really display a temporal and spatial release of entrapped drug once the systems are iv administrated. We hypothesized that the photothermal effect, mediated by a near-infrared (NIR) laser and hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNS), can modulate paclitaxel (PTX) release from polymer micelles, and further result in the enhanced antitumor activity of the micelles. We loaded PTX and HAuNS, which display strong plasmon absorption in the NIR region, into glycolipid-like polymer micelles with an excellent cell internalization capability. The surface of the micelles was conjugated successfully with a peptide, which has the specific-binding with EphB4, a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases overexpressed on cell membrane of numerous tumors, to increase the delivery of PTX into tumor cells. Rapid and repetitive drug release from our polymer (HP-TCS) micelles could be readily achieved upon NIR laser irradiation. Our data demonstrated the specific delivery of HP-TCS micelles into positive-EphB4 tumors using a duel-tumor model after iv administration during the whole experiment process (1-48 h). Interestingly, significantly higher uptake of the micelles by SKOV3 tumors (positive-EphB4) than A549 tumors (negtive-EphB4) was observed, with increased ratio on experiment time. However, the specific cell uptake was observed only during the short incubation time (1-4 h) in vitro. Our data also indicated the treatment of tumor cells with the micelles followed by NIR laser irradiation showed significantly greater toxicity activity than the treatment with the micelles alone, free PTX and the micelles (without PTX loading) plus NIR laser irradiation. The enhanced toxicity activity to tumor cells should be attributed to the enhanced drug cellular uptake mediated by the glycolipid-like micelles, chemical toxicity of the released drug from the micelles due to the trigger of NIR laser, and the photothermal ablation under NIR laser irradiation.</abstract><notes>RC2 GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Netherlands</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23510855 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1392</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1392</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, M.</author><author>Cheng, K.</author><author>Qi, S.</author><author>Liu, H.</author><author>Jiang, Y.</author><author>Jiang, H.</author><author>Li, J.</author><author>Chen, K.</author><author>Zhang, H.</author><author>Cheng, Z.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Department of Diagnostic Ultrasound, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &amp; Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.</auth-address><titles><title>Affibody modified and radiolabeled gold-Iron oxide hetero-nanostructures for tumor PET, optical and MR imaging</title><secondary-title>Biomaterials</secondary-title><alt-title>Biomaterials</alt-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomaterials</full-title><abbr-1>Biomaterials</abbr-1></periodical><alt-periodical><full-title>Biomaterials</full-title><abbr-1>Biomaterials</abbr-1></alt-periodical><pages>2796-806</pages><volume>34</volume><number>11</number><keywords><keyword>CA151459</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>Apr</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1878-5905 (Electronic)&#xD;0142-9612 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>23343632</accession-num><abstract>A highly monodispersed hetero-nanostructure with two different functional nanomaterials (gold (Au) and iron oxide (Fe(3)O(4,) IO)) within one structure was successfully developed as Affibody based trimodality nanoprobe (positron emission tomography, PET; optical imaging; and magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) for imaging of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positive tumors. Unlike other regular nanostructures with a single component, the Au-IO hetero-nanostructures (Au-IONPs) with unique chemical and physical properties have capability to combine several imaging modalities together to provide complementary information. The IO component within hetero-nanostructures serve as a T(2) reporter for MRI; and gold component serve as both optical and PET reporters. Moreover, such hetero-nanoprobes could provide a robust nano-platform for surface-specific modification with both targeting molecules (anti-EGFR Affibody protein) and PET imaging reporters (radiometal (64)Cu chelators) in highly efficient and reliable manner.

Eight key miRNAs, including miR-506, miR-141, and miR-200a, were predicted to regulate 89% of the targets in this network. Follow-up functional experiments illustrate that miR-506 augmented E-cadherin expression, inhibited cell migration and invasion, and prevented TGFbeta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting SNAI2, a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. In human OvCa, miR-506 expression was correlated with decreased SNAI2 and VIM, elevated E-cadherin, and beneficial prognosis. Nanoparticle delivery of miR-506 in orthotopic OvCa mouse models led to E-cadherin induction and reduced tumor growth.</abstract><notes>CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U24CA143835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23410973 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1411</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1411</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, R.</author><author>Huang, Y.</author><author>Mai, J.</author><author>Zhang, G.</author><author>Guo, X.</author><author>Xia, X.</author><author>Koay, E.

The strategy presented here to target ATM for breast cancer therapy involves the use of liposomal-encapsulated, gene-specific ATM siRNA delivered with a well-characterized porous silicon-based multistage vector (MSV) delivery system (MSV/ATM). Biweekly treatment of MSV/ATM suppressed ATM expression in tumor tissues, and consequently inhibited growth of MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumor in nude mice. At the therapeutic dosage, neither free liposomal ATM siRNA nor MSV/ATM triggered an acute immune response in BALB/c mice, including changes in serum cytokines, chemokines or colony-stimulating factors. Weekly treatments of mice with free liposomal ATM siRNA or MSV/ATM for 4 weeks did not cause significant changes in body weight, hematology, blood biochemistry, or major organ histology. These results indicate that MSV/ATM is biocompatible and efficacious in inhibiting tumor growth, and that further preclinical evaluation is warranted for the development of MSV/ATM as a potential therapeutic agent.</abstract><notes>U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;Germany</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23293085 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1374</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1374</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Werner, M.

Nanoparticle (NP) chemotherapeutics possess several properties, such as preferential accumulation in tumors, that are uniquely suited for chemoradiation therapy. To facilitate the clinical translation of NP chemotherapeutics in chemoradiation therapy, we conducted preclinical evaluation of Genexol-PM, the only clinically approved NP chemotherapeutic with a controlled drug release profile, as a radiosensitizer using non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as a model disease. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The physical characteristics and drug release profile of Genexol-PM were characterized. Genexol-PM&apos;s efficacy as a radiosensitizer was evaluated in vitro using NSCLC cell lines and in vivo using mouse xenograft models of NSCLC. Paclitaxel dose to normal lung and liver after Genexol-PM administration were quantified and compared with that after Taxol administration. RESULTS: Genexol-PM has a size of 23.91 +/- 0.41 nm and surface charge of -8.1 +/- 3.1 mV. It releases paclitaxel in a controlled release profile. In vitro evaluation of Genexol-PM as a radiosensitizer showed it is an effective radiosensitizer and is more effective than Taxol, its small molecule counterpart, at the half maximal inhibitory concentration. In vivo study of Genexol-PM as a radiosensitizer demonstrated that it is more effective as a radiosensitizer than Taxol. We also found that Genexol-PM leads to lower paclitaxel exposure to normal lung tissue than Taxol at 6 hours postadministration. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that Genexol-PM is more effective than Taxol as a radiosensitizer in the preclinical setting and holds high potential for clinical translation. Our data support the clinical evaluation of Genexol-PM in chemoradiation therapy for NSCLC.</abstract><notes>1-U54-CA151652-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;5-K12-CA120780-01-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;K12 CA120780/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23708084 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1380</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1380</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Y.</author><author>Su, H.

Neither of these issues could be addressed through engineering-sophisticated gene delivery vehicles. Therefore, we propose a systemic delivery of chemically modified messenger RNA (mRNA) as an alternative to plasmid DNA (pDNA) in cancer gene therapy. Modified mRNA evaded recognition by the innate immune system and was less immunostimulating than dsDNA or regular mRNA. Moreover, the cytoplasmic delivery of mRNA circumvented the nuclear envelope, which resulted in a higher gene expression level. When formulated in the nanoparticle formulation liposome-protamine-RNA (LPR), modified mRNA showed increased nuclease tolerance and was more effectively taken up by tumor cells after systemic administration. The use of LPR resulted in a substantial increase of the gene expression level compared with the equivalent pDNA in the human lung cancer NCI-H460 carcinoma. In a therapeutic model, when modified mRNA encoding herpes simplex virus 1-thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) was systemically delivered to H460 xenograft-bearing nude mice, it was significantly more effective in suppressing tumor growth than pDNA.</abstract><notes>CA125273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA125273-03S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA129835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA149363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA129835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA149363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States&#xD;the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23229091 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1382</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1382</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Valencia, C.

Because of the covalent linkage between the genotype and the phenotype, mRNA-display provides a powerful means for reading and amplifying a peptide or protein sequence after it has been selected from a library with very high diversity. The purpose of this article is to provide a summary of the field and practical framework of mRNA-display-based selections. We summarize the advantages and limitations of selections using mRNA-display as well as the recent applications, namely, the identification of novel affinity reagents, target-binding partners, and enzyme substrates from synthetic peptide or natural proteome libraries. Practically, we provide a detailed procedure for performing mRNA-display-based selections with the aim of identifying protease substrates and binding partners of a target protein. Furthermore, we describe how to confirm the function of the selected protein sequences by biochemical assays and bioinformatic tools.</abstract><notes>AI092228/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA157738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;NS047650/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23201412 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1364</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1364</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Torosean, S.</author><author>Flynn, B.</author><author>Axelsson, J.</author><author>Gunn, J.</author><author>Samkoe, K.

Mean data for uptake in individual tumor lines then showed expected trends with the largest uptake in the most vascularized tumor line. Tumor lines with increased collagen were also consistent with highest interstitial fluid pressure and correlated with lowest uptake of nanoparticles. The data is consistent with a delivery model indicating that while vascular permeability is maximized by neovascular growth, it is inhibited by collagen content and the resulting interstitial pressure. Imaging of these parameters in vivo can lead to better individual noninvasive methods to assess drug penetration in situ.

However its specificity for accumulation in tumors, which is the key factor that determines its efficacy, has always been a challenge. Here we tested a novel strategy to target and treat ovarian cancer, a representative peritoneal cancer, using iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and an alternating magnetic field (AMF). Peritoneal tumors in general are directly accessible to nanoparticles administered intraperitoneally (IP), as opposed to the more commonly attempted intravenous (IV) administration. In addition, tumor-associated immunosuppressive phagocytes, a predominant cell population in the tumor microenvironment of almost all solid tumors, and cells that are critical for tumor progression, are constantly recruited to the tumor, and therefore could possibly function to bring nanoparticles to tumors. Here we demonstrate that tumor-associated peritoneal phagocytes ingest and carry IONPs specifically to tumors and that these specifically delivered nanoparticles can damage tumor cells after IONP-mediated hyperthermia generated by AMF. This illustrates therapeutic possibilities of intraperitoneal (IP) injection of nanoparticles and subsequent ingestion by tumor-associated phagocytes, to directly impact tumors or stimulate antitumor immune responses. This approach could use IONPs combined with AMF as done here, or other nanoparticles with cytotoxic potential. Overall, the data presented here support IP injection of nanoparticles to utilize peritoneal phagocytes as a delivery vehicle in association with IONP-mediated hyperthermia as therapeutic strategies for ovarian and other peritoneal cancers.</abstract><notes>1 U54 CA151662-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA157664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA124515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA157664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;England&#xD;quantitative biosciences from nano to macro</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=22935885 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1393</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1393</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thomas, D.

The nanomedicine community has yet to adopt similar standards to share the diverse and multi-dimensional types of data (including metadata) pertaining to the description and characterization of nanomaterials. Owing to the lack of standardization in representing and sharing nanomaterial data, most of the data currently shared via publications and data resources are incomplete, poorly-integrated, and not suitable for meaningful interpretation and re-use of the data. Specifically, in its current state, data cannot be effectively utilized for the development of predictive models that will inform the rational design of nanomaterials. RESULTS: We have developed a specification called ISA-TAB-Nano, which comprises four spreadsheet-based file formats for representing and integrating various types of nanomaterial data. Three file formats (Investigation, Study, and Assay files) have been adapted from the established ISA-TAB specification; while the Material file format was developed de novo to more readily describe the complexity of nanomaterials and associated small molecules. In this paper, we have discussed the main features of each file format and how to use them for sharing nanomaterial descriptions and assay metadata. CONCLUSION: The ISA-TAB-Nano file formats provide a general and flexible framework to record and integrate nanomaterial descriptions, assay data (metadata and endpoint measurements) and protocol information. Like ISA-TAB, ISA-TAB-Nano supports the use of ontology terms to promote standardized descriptions and to facilitate search and integration of the data. The ISA-TAB-Nano specification has been submitted as an ASTM work item to obtain community feedback and to provide a nanotechnology data-sharing standard for public development and adoption.</abstract><notes>ES016896-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P30 ES03850/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 GM069702/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U01 NS073457/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 HG004028/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;England</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23311978 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1406</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1406</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shen, H.</author><author>Rodriguez-Aguayo, C.</author><author>Xu, R.</author><author>Gonzalez-Villasana, V.</author><author>Mai, J.</author><author>Huang, Y.</author><author>Zhang, G.</author><author>Guo, X.</author><author>Bai, L.</author><author>Qin, G.</author><author>Deng, X.</author><author>Li, Q.</author><author>Erm, D.

However, lack of effective delivery of siRNA has dramatically limited its in vivo applications. We have developed a multistage vector (MSV) system, composed of discoidal porous silicon particles loaded with nanotherapeutics, that directs effective delivery and sustained release of siRNA in tumor tissues. In this study, we evaluated therapeutic efficacy of MSV-loaded EphA2 siRNA (MSV/EphA2) with murine orthotopic models of metastatic ovarian cancers as a first step toward development of a new class of nanotherapeutics for the treatment of ovarian cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor accumulation of MSV/EphA2 and sustained release of siRNA from MSV were analyzed after intravenous administration of MSV/siRNA. Nude mice with metastatic SKOV3ip2 tumors were treated with MSV/EphA2 and paclitaxel, and therapeutic efficacy was assessed. Mice with chemotherapy-resistant HeyA8 ovarian tumors were treated with a combination of MSV/EphA2 and docetaxel, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy was evaluated. RESULTS: Treatment of SKOV3ip2 tumor mice with MSV/EphA2 biweekly for 6 weeks resulted in dose-dependent (5, 10, and 15 mug/mice) reduction of tumor weight (36%, 64%, and 83%) and number of tumor nodules compared with the control groups. In addition, tumor growth was completely inhibited when mice were treated with MSV/EphA2 in combination with paclitaxel. Furthermore, combination treatment with MSV/EphA2 and docetaxel inhibited growth of HeyA8-MDR tumors, which were otherwise resistant to docetaxel treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that MSV/EphA2 merits further development as a novel therapeutic agent for ovarian cancer.</abstract><notes>P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;RC2 GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;United States&#xD;an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23386691 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1390</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1390</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shambat, G.</author><author>Kothapalli, S.

Here we develop a nanobeam photonic crystal (PC) cavity as an advanced cellular nanoprobe, active in nature, and configurable to provide a multitude of actions for both intracellular sensing and control. Our semiconductor nanocavity probes emit photoluminescence (PL) from embedded quantum dots (QD) and sustain high quality resonant photonic modes inside cells. The probes are shown to be minimally cytotoxic to cells from viability studies, and the beams can be loaded in cells and tracked for days at a time, with cells undergoing regular division with the beams. We present in vitro label-free protein sensing with our probes to detect streptavidin as a path towards real-time biomarker and biomolecule detection inside single cells.

We found that a substantial proportion of human epithelial ovarian cancers expressed HORMAD1. In vitro, HORMAD1 siRNA enhanced docetaxel induced apoptosis and substantially reduced the invasive and migratory potential of ovarian cancer cells (2774). In vivo, HORMAD1 siRNA-DOPC treatment resulted in reduced tumor weight, which was further enhanced in combination with cisplatin. HORMAD1 gene silencing resulted in significantly reduced VEGF protein levels and microvessel density compared to controls.

In order to successfully mark glioma tissue a fluorescent tracer must have the ability to penetrate through the blood brain barrier (BBB) and provide delineation in the tumor periphery where heterogeneously intact BBB may exist. In this study it was hypothesized that, due to its smaller size, fluorescently labeled anti-EGFR Affibody protein ( approximately 7 kDa) would provide a more clear delineation of the tumor margin than would fluorescently labeled cetuximab, a full antibody ( approximately 150 kDa) to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). METHODS: Cetuximab and anti-EGFR targeted Affibody were conjugated to two different fluorescent dyes (both emitting in the near-infrared) and injected intravenously into 6 athymic mice which were inoculated orthotopically with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing human U251 glioma cells. Each mouse was sacrificed at 1-h post injection, at which time brains were removed, snap frozen, sectioned and quantitatively analyzed for fluorescence distribution. RESULTS: Ex vivo analysis showed on average, nearly equal concentrations of cetuximab and Affibody within the tumor (on average Affibody made up 49+/-6% of injected protein), however, the cetuximab was more confined to the center of the tumor with Affibody showing significantly higher concentrations at the tumor periphery (on average Affibody made up 72+/-15% of injected protein in the outer 50 um of the tumor). Further ex vivo analysis of detection studies showed that the Affibody provided superior discrimination for differentiation of tumor from surrounding normal brain. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that fluorescently labeled anti-EGFR Affibody can provide significantly better delineation of tumor margins than a fluorescently labeled anti-EGFR antibody and shows considerable potential for guiding margin detection during neurosurgery.</abstract><notes>R01 CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA156177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01CA156177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23593208 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1440</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1440</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Salvador-Morales, C.</author><author>Valencia, P.

White blood cells of the immune system--known as leukocytes--possess all of these properties and exert their targeting ability through cellular membrane interactions. Here, we show that nanoporous silicon particles can successfully perform all these actions when they are coated with cellular membranes purified from leukocytes. These hybrid particles, called leukolike vectors, can avoid being cleared by the immune system. Furthermore, they can communicate with endothelial cells through receptor-ligand interactions, and transport and release a payload across an inflamed reconstructed endothelium. Moreover, leukolike vectors retained their functions when injected in vivo, showing enhanced circulation time and improved accumulation in a tumour.</abstract><notes>TL1 RR024147/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States&#xD;TL1 RR024147/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;England</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23241654 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1388</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1388</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ooi, C.</author><author>Earhart, C.

We also improve the elution efficiencies from between 50% and 60% to close to 90% via optimization of the permanent magnet size and position used to magnetize the sifter. We then explain our observations via the use of finite element software for magnetic field and field gradient distributions, and a particle tracing algorithm, illustrating the impact of magnetic field gradients on the performance of the magnetic sifter.

However, the mechanistic effects of such activation on the tumor vasculature are not well understood. Dopamine (DA), an inhibitory catecholamine, regulates the functions of normal and abnormal blood vessels. Here, we examined whether DA, an inhibitory catecholamine, could block the effects of chronic stress on tumor vasculature and tumor growth. Exogenous administration of DA not only decreased tumor microvessel density but also increased pericyte coverage of tumor vessels following daily restraint stress in mice. Daily restraint stress resulted in significantly increased tumor growth in the SKOV3ip1 and HeyA8 ovarian cancer models. DA treatment blocked stress-mediated increases in tumor growth and increased pericyte coverage of tumor endothelial cells. Whereas the antiangiogenic effect of DA is mediated by dopamine receptor 2 (DR2), our data indicate that DA, through DR1, stimulates vessel stabilization by increasing pericyte recruitment to tumor endothelial cells. DA significantly stimulated migration of mouse 10T1/2 pericyte-like cells in vitro and increased cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate (cAMP) levels in these cells. Moreover, DA or the DR1 agonist SKF 82958 increased platinum concentration in SKOV3ip1 tumor xenografts following cisplatin administration. In conclusion, DA stabilizes tumor blood vessels through activation of pericyte cAMP-protein kinase A signaling pathway by DR1. These findings could have implications for blocking the stimulatory effects of chronic stress on tumor growth.</abstract><notes>CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA160687/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;F31CA126474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;T32 CA101642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA96297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA96300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;Canada</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23633922 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1399</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1399</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moreno-Smith, M.</author><author>Halder, J.

Reduced platinum uptake and increased platinum export are examples of resistance mechanisms that limit the extent of DNA damage. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of the role of ATP11B, a P-type ATPase membrane protein, in cisplatin resistance. We found that ATP11B expression was correlated with higher tumor grade in human ovarian cancer samples and with cisplatin resistance in human ovarian cancer cell lines. ATP11B gene silencing restored the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cell lines to cisplatin in vitro. Combined therapy of cisplatin and ATP11B-targeted siRNA significantly decreased cancer growth in mice bearing ovarian tumors derived from cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant cells. In vitro mechanistic studies on cellular platinum content and cisplatin efflux kinetics indicated that ATP11B enhances the export of cisplatin from cells. The colocalization of ATP11B with fluorescent cisplatin and with vesicular trafficking proteins, such as syntaxin-6 (STX6) and vesicular-associated membrane protein 4 (VAMP4), strongly suggests that ATP11B contributes to secretory vesicular transport of cisplatin from Golgi to plasma membrane. In conclusion, inhibition of ATP11B expression could serve as a therapeutic strategy to overcome cisplatin resistance.</abstract><notes>CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;T32 CA101642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23585472 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1378</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1378</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, S.

It is part of the standard of care and curative treatment of many cancers.

Recent advances in nanomedicine have provided a unique and unprecedented opportunity for improving chemoradiotherapy.

Combining both a rigid matrix (polypyrrole) and a dynamic network (polyol-borate), strong and flexible polymer films were developed that can exchange water with the environment to induce film expansion and contraction, resulting in rapid and continuous locomotion. The film actuator can generate contractile stress up to 27 megapascals, lift objects 380 times heavier than itself, and transport cargo 10 times heavier than itself. We have assembled a generator by associating this actuator with a piezoelectric element. Driven by water gradients, this generator outputs alternating electricity at ~0.3 hertz, with a peak voltage of ~1.0 volt. The electrical energy is stored in capacitors that could power micro- and nanoelectronic devices.</abstract><notes>CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;HHSN268201000045C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;HHSN268201000045C/PHS HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23307738 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1389</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1389</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, J.

However, the relationship between gene expression and onset of disease often remains obscure. The great advances in protein microarrays allow us to investigate this unclear question through protein profiles, which are regarded as more reliable than gene expressions to serve as the harbinger of disease onset or as the biomarker of disease treatment monitoring. The authors review two relatively new platforms of protein arrays, along with an introduction to the common basis of protein array technologies. Immobilization of proteins on the surface of arrays and neutralizing reactive areas after the immobilization are key practical issues in the field of protein array. One of the emerging protein array technologies is the magneto-nanosensor array, where giant magnetoresistive sensors are used to quantitatively measure the analytes of interest, which are labeled with magnetic nanoparticles. Similar to giant magnetoresistive sensors, several different ways of utilizing magnetic properties for biomolecular detection have been developed and are reviewed here.

Contrary to earlier reports that CNT oxidation initiates at the end of the tube and proceeds along its length, our findings show that only the outside graphene layer is being removed and, on occasion, the interior inner wall is oxidized, presumably due to oxygen infiltrating into the hollow nanotube through an open end or breaks in the tube. We believe that this work provides the foundation for a greater scientific understanding of the mechanism underlying the nanotube oxidation process, as well as guidelines to manipulate the nanotubes&apos; structure or prevent their oxidation.</abstract><notes>R01 CA134598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01CA134598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151459-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23360330 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1438</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1438</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kay, E.

Hence, therapeutics that dampen inflammation and enhance resolution are of considerable interest. In this study, we demonstrate the proresolving activity of sub-100-nm nanoparticles (NPs) containing the anti-inflammatory peptide Ac2-26, an annexin A1/lipocortin 1-mimetic peptide. These NPs were engineered using biodegradable diblock poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-polyethyleneglycol and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-polyethyleneglycol collagen IV-targeted polymers. Using a self-limited zymosan-induced peritonitis model, we show that the Ac2-26 NPs (100 ng per mouse) were significantly more potent than Ac2-26 native peptide at limiting recruitment of polymononuclear neutrophils (56% vs. 30%) and at decreasing the resolution interval up to 4 h. Moreover, systemic administration of collagen IV targeted Ac2-26 NPs (in as low as 1 microg peptide per mouse) was shown to significantly block tissue damage in hind-limb ischemia-reperfusion injury by up to 30% in comparison with controls. Together, these findings demonstrate that Ac2-26 NPs are proresolving in vivo and raise the prospect of their use in chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis.</abstract><notes>CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;HHSN268201000045C/PHS HHS/United States&#xD;Comparative Study&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23533277 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1371</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1371</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, S.

Nanoparticles are rapidly cleared by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Approaches such as grafting polyethylene glycol onto particles (PEGylation) extend circulation times; however, these particles are still cleared, and the processes involved in this clearance remain poorly understood. Here, we present an intravital microscopy-based assay for the quantification of nanoparticle clearance, allowing us to determine the effect of mouse strain and immune system function on particle clearance. We demonstrate that mouse strains that are prone to Th1 immune responses clear nanoparticles at a slower rate than Th2-prone mice. Using depletion strategies, we show that both granulocytes and macrophages participate in the enhanced clearance observed in Th2-prone mice. Macrophages isolated from Th1 strains took up fewer particles in vitro than macrophages from Th2 strains. Treating macrophages from Th1 strains with cytokines to differentiate them into M2 macrophages increased the amount of particle uptake. Conversely, treating macrophages from Th2 strains with cytokines to differentiate them into M1 macrophages decreased their particle uptake. Moreover, these results were confirmed in human monocyte-derived macrophages, suggesting that global immune regulation has a significant impact on nanoparticle clearance in humans.</abstract><notes>U54 CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal article</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23778144 </url></related-urls></urls><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1326</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1326</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Irvin, DK. </author><author>Patil, C.</author><author>Black, K.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Kateb, B.</author><author>Hiess, J.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Immune Based Targeting in Cancer</title><secondary-title>Nanoneurosurgery</secondary-title></titles><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><isbn>9781439849415</isbn><urls></urls></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1421</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1421</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, H.</author><author>Liu, Y.</author><author>Daniluk, J.</author><author>Gaiser, S.</author><author>Chu, J.</author><author>Wang, H.</author><author>Li, Z.

This transcription factor regulates genes that control many cell activities, including inflammation and survival. There is evidence that activation of NF-kappaB protects against pancreatitis, and, in other cases, that it promotes this disease. We compared the effects of NF-kappaB in different mouse models of pancreatitis to understand these complications. METHODS: To model constitutive activation of NF-kappaB, we expressed a transgene that encodes its p65 subunit or the inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK)2 in pancreatic acinar cells of mice. We analyzed effects on pancreatic tissues and levels of NF-kappaB target genes in these mice and compared them with mice that did not express transgenic p65 or IKK2 (controls). RESULTS: Transgenic expression of p65 led to compensatory expression of the inhibitory subunit IKB-alpha and, therefore, no clear phenotype. However, p65 transgenic mice given injections of cerulein, to induce acute pancreatitis, had higher levels of NF-kappaB activity in acinar cells, greater levels of inflammation, and more severe outcomes than control mice. In contrast, constitutive expression of IKK2 directly increased the activity of NF-kappaB in acinar cells and induced pancreatitis. Prolonged activity of IKK2 (3 months) resulted in activation of stellate cells, loss of acinar cells, and fibrosis, which are characteristics of chronic pancreatitis. Co-expression of IKK2 and p65 greatly increased the expression of inflammatory mediators and the severity of pancreatitis, compared with control mice. CONCLUSIONS: The level of NF-kappaB activation correlates with the severity of acute pancreatitis in mice. Longer periods of activation (3 months) lead to chronic pancreatitis. These findings indicate that strategies to inactivate NF-kappaB might be used to treat patients with acute or chronic pancreatitis.</abstract><notes>CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;DK052067/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P20 CA101936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA102701/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 AA020822/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 DK052067/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23041324 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1375</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1375</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hu, Y.</author><author>Haynes, M.

Targeted particles exhibited rapid and extensive hepatic accumulation and were predominantly internalized by hepatocytes, while the inclusion of such peptides in LCP was sufficient to elicit high degrees of nuclear translocation of plasmid DNA. Monocyclic CR8C significantly enhanced in vivo gene expression over 10-fold more than linear CR8C, likely due to a release-favoring mechanism of the DNA/peptide complex. Though 100-fold lower in activity than that achieved via hydrodynamic injection, this formulation presents as a much less invasive alternative.

The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors is upregulated in melanoma by key oncogenic drivers. HIFs promote the activation of genes involved in cancer initiation, progression, and metastases. Hypoxia has been shown to enhance the invasiveness and metastatic potential of tumor cells by regulating the genes involved in the breakdown of the ECM as well as genes that control motility and adhesion of tumor cells. Using a Pten-deficient, Braf-mutant genetically engineered mouse model of melanoma, we demonstrated that inactivation of HIF1alpha or HIF2alpha abrogates metastasis without affecting primary tumor formation. HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha drive melanoma invasion and invadopodia formation through PDGFRalpha and focal adhesion kinase-mediated (FAK-mediated) activation of SRC and by coordinating ECM degradation via MT1-MMP and MMP2 expression.

Here, we describe a new method for assembling a targeted nanoparticle that utilizes the reversible covalent complexation between boronic acids and diols to achieve a targeted nanoparticle for the delivery of the anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT). CPT is conjugated to a biocompatible, hydrophilic copolymer of mucic acid and PEG (MAP). When this polymer-drug conjugate is placed in water, it self-assembles into MAP-CPT nanoparticles of ca. 30 nm (diameter) and slightly negative zeta potential. The antibody Herceptin is attached to a boronic acid via a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer, and this boronic acid-containing targeting moiety is complexed with the diol-containing MAP to form a targeted MAP-CPT nanoparticle. The addition of Herceptin targeting agent to the MAP-CPT nanoparticles yields targeted MAP-CPT nanoparticles with increased nanoparticle size to ca. 40 nm (diameter). The main mechanisms of CPT release from MAP-CPT nanoparticles are found by in vitro analysis to be hydrolysis and nanoparticle disruption by fat. Cellular uptake of nanoparticles is enhanced by 70% compared to nontargeted version by the incorporation of a single Herceptin antibody targeting agent per nanoparticle. This single Herceptin antibody targeted MAP-CPT nanoparticle system carries ca. 60 CPT molecules per nanoparticle and shows prolonged plasma circulation with an elimination half-life of 21.2 h and AUC value of 2766 mug.h/mL at a 10 mg CPT/kg tail vein injection in mice.</abstract><notes>CA 151819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23461746 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1429</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1429</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, H.</author><author>Davis, M.

Here, we report the first in vivo, antitumor results of a nanoparticle formed via this new assembly methodology. A nanoparticle consisting of a mucic acid polymer conjugate of camptothecin (CPT), MAP-CPT, and containing on average one Herceptin antibody is investigated in nude mice bearing HER2 overexpressing BT-474 human breast cancer tumors. Nontargeted MAP-CPT and antibody-containing MAP-CPT nanoparticles of ca. 30-40 nm diameter and slightly negative zeta potential show prolonged in vivo circulation and similar biodistributions after intravenous tail vein injections in mice. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the nontargeted and Herceptin-containing MAP-CPT nanoparticles is found to be 10 and 8 mg of CPT/kg, respectively, in mice. Mice bearing BT-474 human breast tumors treated with nontargeted MAP-CPT nanoparticles at 8 mg of CPT/kg show significant tumor growth inhibition (mean tumor volume of 63 mm3) when compared to irinotecan at 80 mg/kg (mean tumor volume of 575 mm3) and CPT at 8 mg/kg (mean tumor volume of 808 mm3) at the end of the study. Herceptin antibody treatment at 5.9 mg/kg results in complete tumor regressions in 5 out of 8 mice, with a mean tumor volume of 60 mm3 at the end of the study. Mice treated with MAP-CPT nanoparticles at 1 mg of CPT/kg do not show tumor inhibition. However, all mice receiving administrations of MAP-CPT nanoparticles (1 mg of CPT/kg) that contain on average a single Herceptin molecule per nanoparticle (5.9 mg of Herceptin equivalent/kg) show complete tumor regression by the end of the study. These results demonstrate that the antitumor efficacy of nanoparticles carrying anticancer drugs can be enhanced by incorporating on average a single antibody.</abstract><notes>U54 CA151819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal article</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23676007 </url></related-urls></urls><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1402</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1402</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frieboes, H.

Here, a computational model is presented to predict the development of tumor neovasculature over time and the specific, vascular accumulation of blood-borne NPs. A multidimensional tumor-growth model is integrated with a mesoscale formulation for the NP adhesion to blood vessel walls. The fraction of injected NPs depositing within the diseased vasculature and their spatial distribution is computed as a function of tumor stage, from 0 to day 24 post-tumor inception. As the malignant mass grows in size, average blood flow and shear rates increase within the tumor neovasculature, reaching values comparable with those measured in healthy, pre-existing vessels already at 10 days. The NP vascular affinity, interpreted as the likelihood for a blood-borne NP to firmly adhere to the vessel walls, is a fundamental parameter in this analysis and depends on NP size and ligand density, and vascular receptor expression. For high vascular affinities, NPs tend to accumulate mostly at the inlet tumor vessels leaving the inner and outer vasculature depleted of NPs. For low vascular affinities, NPs distribute quite uniformly intra-tumorally but exhibit low accumulation doses. It is shown that an optimal vascular affinity can be identified providing the proper balance between accumulation dose and uniform spatial distribution of the NPs. This balance depends on the stage of tumor development (vascularity and endothelial receptor expression) and the NP properties (size, ligand density and ligand-receptor molecular affinity). Also, it is demonstrated that for insufficiently developed vascular networks, NPs are transported preferentially through the healthy, pre-existing vessels, thus bypassing the tumor mass. The computational tool described here can effectively select an optimal NP formulation presenting high accumulation doses and uniform spatial intra-tumor distributions as a function of the development stage of the malignancy.</abstract><notes>54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50GM76516/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA143907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA149196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;UL1 RR024148/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23468887 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1400</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1400</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fine, D.</author><author>Grattoni, A.</author><author>Goodall, R.</author><author>Bansal, S.

The technologies to be reviewed are subcutaneous nanochannel drug delivery implants for the continuous tunable zero-order release of therapeutics, multi-stage logic embedded vectors for the targeted systemic distribution of both therapeutic and imaging contrast agents, silicon and porous silicon nanowires for investigating cellular interactions and processes as well as for molecular and drug delivery applications, porous silicon (pSi) as inclusions into biocomposites for tissue engineering, especially as it applies to bone repair and regrowth, and porous silica chips for proteomic profiling. In the case of the biocomposites, the specifically designed pSi inclusions not only add to the structural robustness, but can also promote tissue and bone regrowth, fight infection, and reduce pain by releasing stimulating factors and other therapeutic agents stored within their porous network. The common material thread throughout all of these constructs, silicon and its associated dielectrics (silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, etc.), can be precisely and accurately machined using the same scalable micro- and nanofabrication protocols that are ubiquitous within the semiconductor industry. These techniques lend themselves to the high throughput production of exquisitely defined and monodispersed nanoscale features that should eliminate architectural randomness as a source of experimental variation thereby potentially leading to more rapid clinical translation.</abstract><notes>1U54CA151668-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R33CA122864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;Germany</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23584841 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1373</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1373</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dunn, S.

SEIP can be viewed as a generalization of the coefficient of variation to regression problem when x is predicted using y-value. We employ nonstandard statistical methods to treat the inverse prediction, which has an infinite mean and variance due to the presence of a normally distributed variable in the denominator. We develop confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for SEIP on the basis of the normal approximation and using the exact statistical inference based on the noncentral t-distribution. We derive the power functions for both approaches and test them via statistical simulations. The theoretical SEIP, as the ratio of the regression standard error to the slope, is viewed as reciprocal of the signal-to-noise ratio, a popular measure of signal processing. The SEIP, as a figure of merit for inverse prediction, can be used for comparison of calibration curves with different dependent variables and slopes. We illustrate our theory with electron paramagnetic resonance tooth dosimetry for a rapid estimation of the radiation dose received in the event of nuclear terrorism.</abstract><notes>CA130880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;HHSO100201100024C/PHS HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA130880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U19 AI091173/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U19AI091173/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, P.H.S.&#xD;England</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23124816 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1354</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1354</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, S.

Here, we present a dual-tracer optical technique for noninvasive estimation of specific receptor binding in cancer. A multispectral MRI-coupled fluorescence molecular tomography system was used to image the uptake kinetics of two fluorescent tracers injected simultaneously, one tracer targeted to the receptor of interest and the other tracer a nontargeted reference. These dynamic tracer data were then fit to a dual-tracer compartmental model to estimate the density of receptors available for binding in the tissue. Applying this approach to mice with deep-seated gliomas that overexpress the EGF receptor produced an estimate of available receptor density of 2.3 +/- 0.5 nM (n = 5), consistent with values estimated in comparative invasive imaging and ex vivo studies.</abstract><notes>R01 CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA156177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23671066 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1398</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1398</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Das, H.</author><author>Wang, Z.</author><author>Niazi, M.

We hypothesize that underestimating the role of biophysical factors that impact the delivery of drugs or cytotoxic cells to the target sites (for associated preferential cytotoxicity or cell signaling modulation) may be responsible for the poor clinical outcome. Therefore, instead of focusing exclusively on the investigation of molecular mechanisms in cancer cells, convection-diffusion of cytotoxic molecules and migration of cancer-killing cells within tumor tissue should be taken into account to improve therapeutic effectiveness. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a mathematical model of the interstitial diffusion and uptake of small cytotoxic molecules secreted by T-cells, which is capable of predicting breast cancer growth inhibition as measured both in vitro and in vivo. Our analysis shows that diffusion barriers of cytotoxic molecules conspire with gammadelta T-cell scarcity in tissue to limit the inhibitory effects of gammadelta T-cells on cancer cells. This may increase the necessary ratios of gammadelta T-cells to cancer cells within tissue to unrealistic values for having an intended therapeutic effect, and decrease the effectiveness of the immunotherapeutic treatment.</abstract><notes>1U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;1U54CA143907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;1U54CA149196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;1U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;K01 AR054114/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01CA134451/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R44 HL092706-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23620747 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1407</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1407</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coleman, R.

Robust clinical investigation, particularly with modifications to primary treatment surgical goals and adjuvant therapy are increasing median progression-free survival and overall survival, although the cure rates have been affected only modestly. Maintenance therapy holds promise, but studies have yet to identify an agent and/or strategy that can affect survival. Recurrent disease is largely an incurable state; however, current intervention with selected surgery, combination and targeted therapy and investigational protocols are impacting progression-free survival. Ovarian cancer is a diverse and genomically complex disease, which commands global attention. Rational investigation must balance the high rate of discovery with lagging clinical investigation and limited patient resources. Nevertheless, growth in our armamentarium offers unprecedented opportunities for patients suffering with this disease. This Review presents and reviews the contemporary management of the disease spectrum termed epithelial &apos;ovarian&apos; cancer and describes the direction and early results of clinical investigation.</abstract><notes>CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;England</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23381004 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1403</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1403</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cervadoro, A.</author><author>Giverso, C.</author><author>Pande, R.</author><author>Sarangi, S.</author><author>Preziosi, L.</author><author>Wosik, J.</author><author>Brazdeikis, A.</author><author>Decuzzi, P.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Department of Translational Imaging, The Methodist Hospital Research Institute, Houston, Texas, United States of America.</auth-address><titles><title>Design maps for the hyperthermic treatment of tumors with superparamagnetic nanoparticles</title><secondary-title>PLoS One</secondary-title><alt-title>PloS one</alt-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS One</full-title><abbr-1>PloS one</abbr-1></periodical><alt-periodical><full-title>PLoS One</full-title><abbr-1>PloS one</abbr-1></alt-periodical><pages>e57332</pages><volume>8</volume><number>2</number><keywords><keyword>CA151668</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1932-6203 (Electronic)&#xD;1932-6203 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>23451208</accession-num><abstract>A plethora of magnetic nanoparticles has been developed and investigated under different alternating magnetic fields (AMF) for the hyperthermic treatment of malignant tissues. Yet, clinical applications of magnetic hyperthermia are sporadic, mostly due to the low energy conversion efficiency of the metallic nanoparticles and the high tissue concentrations required. Here, we study the hyperthermic performance of commercially available formulations of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs), with core diameter of 5, 7 and 14 nm, in terms of absolute temperature increase DeltaT and specific absorption rate (SAR). These nanoparticles are operated under a broad range of AMF conditions, with frequency f varying between 0.2 and 30 MHz; field strength H ranging from 4 to 10 kA m(-1); and concentration cMNP varying from 0.02 to 3.5 mg ml(-1). At high frequency field ( approximately 30 MHz), non specific heating dominates and DeltaT correlates with the electrical conductivity of the medium. At low frequency field (&lt;1 MHz), non specific heating is negligible and the relaxation of the SPIO within the AMF is the sole energy source. We show that the DeltaT of the medium grows linearly with cMNP , whereas the SARMNP of the magnetic nanoparticles is independent of cMNP and varies linearly with f and H(2) . Using a computational model for heat transport in a biological tissue, the minimum requirements for local hyperthermia (Ttissue &gt;42 degrees C) and thermal ablation (Ttissue &gt;50 degrees C) are derived in terms of cMNP , operating AMF conditions and blood perfusion. The resulting maps can be used to rationally design hyperthermic treatments and identifying the proper route of administration - systemic versus intratumor injection - depending on the magnetic and biodistribution properties of the nanoparticles.</abstract><notes>U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;UL1 RR024148/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23451208 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1444</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1444</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bonner, D.

The argument is often made that the degradability of such polymers, generally synthesized with either disulfide or hydrolytically degradable crosslinkers, is critical to the high efficiency and low toxicity of the system. In this work, we present a crosslinked linear PEI (xLPEI) system in which either disulfide-responsive or non-degradable linkages are incorporated. As with previous systems, strong transfection efficiency in comparison with commercial standards was achieved with low cytotoxicity. However, these properties were shown to be present when either the degradable or non-degradable crosslinker was used. Uncomplexed polymer was demonstrated to be the critical factor determining transfection efficiency for these polymers, mediating efficient endosomal escape without signs of cell membrane damage. While several crosslinked PEI systems in the literature have demonstrated the effect of the disulfide moiety, this work demonstrates that disulfide-mediated unpackaging may not be as important as conventionally thought for some PEI systems.</abstract><notes>1U54CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01EB008082/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;Netherlands&#xD;official journal of the Controlled Release Society</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=22995755 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1357</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1357</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baird, J.

Because microbes or microbial constituents are powerful adjuvants to stimulate immune responses, we evaluated whether intratumoral administration of a highly immunogenic but attenuated parasite could induce rejection of an established poorly immunogenic tumor. We treated intradermal B16F10 murine melanoma by intratumoral injection of an attenuated strain of Toxoplasma gondii (cps) that cannot replicate in vivo and therefore is not infective. The cps treatment stimulated a strong CD8(+) T cell-mediated antitumor immune response in vivo that regressed established primary melanoma. The cps monotherapy rapidly modified the tumor microenvironment, halting tumor growth, and subsequently, as tumor-reactive T cells expanded, the tumors disappeared and rarely returned. The treatment required live cps that could invade cells and also required CD8(+) T cells and NK cells, but did not require CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-12, IFN-gamma, and the CXCR3-stimulating cytokines are required for full treatment efficacy. The treatment developed systemic antitumor immune activity as well as antitumor immune memory and therefore might have an impact against human metastatic disease. The approach is not specific for either B16F10 or melanoma. Direct intratumoral injection of cps has efficacy against an inducible genetic melanoma model and transplantable lung and ovarian tumors, demonstrating potential for broad clinical use. The combination of efficacy, systemic antitumor immune response, and complete attenuation with no observed host toxicity demonstrates the potential value of this novel cancer therapy.</abstract><notes>1P30RR032136/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States&#xD;5P30CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;AI041930/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA120777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA134799/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 AI041930/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA120777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA134799/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;T32 AI007363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;United States&#xD;1950)</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23225891 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1408</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1408</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Armaiz-Pena, G.

In human ovarian cancer samples, high tumoural noradrenaline levels were correlated with high pSrc(Y419) levels.

From an experimental standpoint, very little is known to date about ion-pair dynamics in biological macromolecular systems. Absorption, infrared, and Raman spectroscopic methods were previously used to characterize dynamic properties of ion pairs, but these methods can be applied only to small compounds. Here, using NMR (15)N relaxation and hydrogen-bond scalar (15)N-(31)P J-couplings ((h3)J(NP)), we have investigated the dynamics of the ion pairs between lysine side-chain NH3(+) amino groups and DNA phosphate groups at the molecular interface of the HoxD9 homeodomain-DNA complex. We have determined the order parameters and the correlation times for C-N bond rotation and reorientation of the lysine NH3(+) groups. Our data indicate that the NH3(+) groups in the intermolecular ion pairs are highly dynamic at the protein-DNA interface, which should lower the entropic costs for protein-DNA association. Judging from the C-N bond-rotation correlation times along with experimental and quantum-chemically derived (h3)J(NP) hydrogen-bond scalar couplings, it seems that breakage of hydrogen bonds in the ion pairs occurs on a sub-nanosecond time scale. Interestingly, the oxygen-to-sulfur substitution in a DNA phosphate group was found to enhance the mobility of the NH3(+) group in the intermolecular ion pair. This can partially account for the affinity enhancement of the protein-DNA association by the oxygen-to-sulfur substitution, which is a previously observed but poorly understood phenomenon.</abstract><notes>HHSN268201000037C/PHS HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23406569 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1430</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1430</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Akhavan, D.</author><author>Pourzia, A.

Multiple genetic mechanisms of acquired TKI resistance have been identified in several types of human cancer. However, the possibility that cancer cells may also evade treatment by co-opting physiologically regulated receptors has not been addressed. Here, we show the first example of this alternate mechanism in brain tumors by showing that EGF receptor (EGFR)-mutant glioblastomas (GBMs) evade EGFR TKIs by transcriptionally de-repressing platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta). Mechanistic studies show that EGFRvIII signaling actively suppresses PDGFRbeta transcription in an mTORC1- and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent manner. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of oncogenic EGFR renders GBMs dependent on the consequently de-repressed PDGFRbeta signaling for growth and survival. Importantly, combined inhibition of EGFR and PDGFRbeta signaling potently suppresses tumor growth in vivo. These data identify a novel, nongenetic TKI resistance mechanism in brain tumors and provide compelling rationale for combination therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide the fi rst clinical and biologic evidence for receptor tyrosinekinase (RTK) &quot;switching&quot; as a mechanism of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in GBM and provide a molecular explanation of how tumors can become &quot;addicted&quot; to a non amplified, nonmutated, physiologically regulated RTK to evade targeted treatment.</abstract><notes>5T32CA009120-35/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA41996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;NS73831/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P01-CA95616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P30CA23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 NS073831/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;UL1TR000124/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23533263 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>681</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">681</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zuckerman, J.

Here we present novel evidence that peripheral nerve injury diminishes glycine-mediated inhibition and induces a depolarizing shift in the reversal potential of glycine-mediated currents (E(glycine)) in spinal dorsal horn neurons. Blocking glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors normalizes synaptic inhibition, E(glycine), and KCC2 by nerve injury. Strikingly, nerve injury increases calcium-dependent calpain activity in the spinal cord that in turn causes KCC2 cleavage at the C terminus. Inhibiting calpain blocks KCC2 cleavage induced by nerve injury and NMDA, thereby normalizing E(glycine). Furthermore, calpain inhibition or silencing of mu-calpain at the spinal level reduces neuropathic pain. Thus, nerve injury promotes proteolytic cleavage of KCC2 through NMDA receptor-calpain activation, resulting in disruption of chloride homeostasis and diminished synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord. Targeting calpain may represent a new strategy for restoring KCC2 levels and tonic synaptic inhibition and for treating chronic neuropathic pain.</abstract><notes>CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;GM064830/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;NS045602/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;NS073935/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 NS073935/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=22854961 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1126</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1126</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zheng, D.</author><author>Giljohann, D.

However, the epidermal barrier typically precludes entry of gene-suppressing therapy unless the barrier is disrupted. We now show that spherical nucleic acid nanoparticle conjugates (SNA-NCs), gold cores surrounded by a dense shell of highly oriented, covalently immobilized siRNA, freely penetrate almost 100% of keratinocytes in vitro, mouse skin, and human epidermis within hours after application. Significantly, these structures can be delivered in a commercial moisturizer or phosphate-buffered saline, and do not require barrier disruption or transfection agents, such as liposomes, peptides, or viruses. SNA-NCs targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an important gene for epidermal homeostasis, are &gt; 100-fold more potent and suppress longer than siRNA delivered with commercial lipid agents in cultured keratinocytes. Topical delivery of 1.5 uM EGFR siRNA (50 nM SNA-NCs) for 3 wk to hairless mouse skin almost completely abolishes EGFR expression, suppresses downstream ERK phosphorylation, and reduces epidermal thickness by almost 40%. Similarly, EGFR mRNA in human skin equivalents is reduced by 52% after 60 h of treatment with 25 nM EGFR SNA-NCs. Treated skin shows no clinical or histological evidence of toxicity. No cytokine activation in mouse blood or tissue samples is observed, and after 3 wk of topical skin treatment, the SNA structures are virtually undetectable in internal organs. SNA conjugates may be promising agents for personalized, topically delivered gene therapy of cutaneous tumors, skin inflammation, and dominant negative genetic skin disorders.</abstract><notes>Zheng, Dan&#xD;Giljohann, David A&#xD;Chen, David L&#xD;Massich, Matthew D&#xD;Wang, Xiao-Qi&#xD;Iordanov, Hristo&#xD;Mirkin, Chad A&#xD;Paller, Amy S&#xD;CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P30AR057216/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 AR060810/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;UL1 RR025741/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/&#xD;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Jul 24;109(30):11975-80. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1118425109.

It interrogates nuclei of atoms in a living subject, providing detailed delineation with high spatial and temporal resolutions. To compensate the innate low sensitivity, MRI contrast probes were developed and widely used. These are typically paramagnetic or superparamagnetic materials, functioning by reducing relaxation times of nearby protons. Previously, gadolinium(Gd)-based T(1) contrast probes were dominantly used. However, it was found recently that their uses are occasionally associated with nephrogenic system fibrosis (NSF), which suggests a need of finding alternatives. Among the efforts, manganese-containing nanoparticles have attracted much attention. By careful engineering, manganese nanoparticles with comparable r(1) relaxivities can be yielded. Moreover, other functionalities, be a targeting motif, a therapeutic agent or a second imaging component, can be loaded onto these nanoparticles, resulting in multifunctional nanoplatforms.</abstract><notes>Zhen, Zipeng; Xie, Jin; Australia; Theranostics. 2012;2(1):45-54.

We have previously identified the human Ecd protein (human ortholog of Drosophila Ecdysoneless, hereafter called Ecd) as a novel promoter of mammalian cell cycle progression, a function related to its ability to remove the repressive effects of Rb-family tumor suppressors on E2F transcription factors. Given the frequent dysregulation of cell cycle regulatory components in human cancer, we used immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded tissues to examine Ecd expression in normal breast tissue versus tissues representing increasing breast cancer progression. Initial studies of a smaller cohort without outcomes information showed that Ecd expression was barely detectable in normal breast tissue and in hyperplasia of breast, but high levels of Ecd were detected in benign breast hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDCs) of the breast. In this cohort of 104 IDC patients, Ecd expression levels showed a positive correlation with higher grade (P=0.04). Further analyses of Ecd expression using a larger, independent cohort (954) confirmed these results, with a strong positive correlation of elevated Ecd expression with higher histological grade (P=0.013), mitotic index (P=0.032), and Nottingham Prognostic Index score (P=0.014). Ecd expression was positively associated with HER2/neu (P=0.002) overexpression, a known marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer. Significantly, increased Ecd expression showed a strong positive association with shorter breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) (P=0.008) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.003) in HER2/neu overexpressing patients. Taken together, our results reveal Ecd as a novel marker for breast cancer progression and show that levels of Ecd expression predict poorer survival in Her2/neu overexpressing breast cancer patients.</abstract><notes>Zhao, Xiangshan&#xD;Mirza, Sameer&#xD;Alshareeda, Alaa&#xD;Zhang, Ying&#xD;Gurumurthy, Channabasavaiah Basavaraju&#xD;Bele, Aditya&#xD;Kim, Jun Hyun&#xD;Mohibi, Shakur&#xD;Goswami, Monica&#xD;Lele, Subodh M&#xD;West, William&#xD;Qiu, Fang&#xD;Ellis, Ian O&#xD;Rakha, Emad A&#xD;Green, Andrew R&#xD;Band, Hamid&#xD;Band, Vimla&#xD;5U01CA151806-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA105489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA116552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA144027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA87986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA96844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA99163/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA099163-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Netherlands&#xD;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2012 Jul;134(1):171-80.

Recent molecular profiling has identified six major subtypes of breast cancer: basal-like, ErbB2-overexpressing, normal breast epithelial-like, luminal A and B, and claudin-low subtypes. To help understand the relationship among mammary stem/progenitor cells and breast cancer subtypes, we have recently derived distinct hTERT-immortalized human mammary stem/progenitor cell lines: a K5(+)/K19(-) type, and a K5(+)/K19(+) type. Under specific culture conditions, bipotent K5(+)/K19(-) stem/progenitor cells differentiated into stable clonal populations that were K5(-)/K19(-) and exhibit self-renewal and unipotent myoepithelial differentiation potential in contrast to the parental K5(+)/K19(-) cells which are bipotent. These K5(-)/K19(-) cells function as myoepithelial progenitor cells and constitutively express markers of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and show high invasive and migratory abilities. In addition, these cells express a microarray signature of claudin-low breast cancers. The EMT characteristics of an un-transformed unipotent mammary myoepithelial progenitor cells together with claudin-low signature suggests that the claudin-low breast cancer subtype may arise from myoepithelial lineage committed progenitors. Availability of immortal MPCs should allow a more definitive analysis of their potential to give rise to claudin-low breast cancer subtype and facilitate biological and molecular/biochemical studies of this disease.</abstract><notes>Zhao, Xiangshan; Malhotra, Gautam K; Band, Hamid; Band, Vimla; 5U01CA151806-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA105489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA116552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA144027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA87986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA96844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA99163/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e35338.

This is largely due to their unique optical properties such as high brightness and narrow emission band as well as other advantages over traditional organic fluorophores. New molecular sensing strategies based on QDs have been developed in pursuit of high sensitivity, high throughput, and multiplexing capabilities. For traditional biological applications, QDs have already begun to replace traditional organic fluorophores to serve as simple fluorescent reporters in immunoassays, microarrays, fluorescent imaging applications, and other assay platforms. In addition, smarter, more advanced QD probes such as quantum dot fluorescence resonance energy transfer (QD-FRET) sensors, quenching sensors, and barcoding systems are paving the way for highly-sensitive genetic and epigenetic detection of diseases, multiplexed identification of infectious pathogens, and tracking of intracellular drug and gene delivery. When combined with microfluidics and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy, the detection limit is further enhanced to single molecule level. Recently, investigations have revealed that QDs participate in series of new phenomena and exhibit interesting non-photoluminescent properties. Some of these new findings are now being incorporated into novel assays for gene copy number variation (CNV) studies and DNA methylation analysis with improved quantification resolution. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on the latest developments of QD based molecular diagnostic platforms in which QD plays a versatile and essential role.</abstract><notes>Zhang, Yi&#xD;Wang, Tza-Huei&#xD;Australia&#xD;Theranostics. 2012;2(7):631-54.

We report a new observation where the electrophoretic mobility of a quantum dot/DNA nanoassembly can be precisely modulated by the degree of surface DNA conjugation. By using streptavidin-coated quantum dots (QDs) as nanotethers to gather biotin-labeled DNA into electrophoretic nanoassemblies, the QD surface charge is modulated and transformed into electrophoretic mobility shifts using standard agarose gel electrophoresis. Typical fluorescent assays quantify based on relative intensity. However, this phenomenon uses a novel approach that accurately maps DNA quantity into shifts in relative band position. This property was applied in a QD-enabled nanoassay called quantum dot electrophoretic mobility shift assay (QEMSA) that enables accurate quantification of DNA targets down to 1.1-fold (9%) changes in quantity, beyond what is achievable in qPCR. In addition to these experimental findings, an analytical model is presented to explain this behavior. Finally, QEMSA was applied to both genetic and epigenetic analysis of cancer. First, it was used to analyze copy number variation (CNV) of the RSF1/HBXAP gene, where conventional approaches for CNV analysis based on comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), microarrays, and qPCR are unable to reliably differentiate less than 2-fold changes in copy number. Then, QEMSA was used for DNA methylation analysis of the p16/CDK2A tumor suppressor gene, where its ability to detect subtle changes in methylation was shown to be superior to that of qPCR.</abstract><notes>Zhang, Yi; Liu, Kelvin J; Wang, Tian-Li; Shih, Ie-Ming; Wang, Tza-Huei; P50CA058184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA129080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA155305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21CA120742/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2012 Jan 24;6(1):858-64.

Nanomaterials offer several advantages as therapeutic and diagnostic tools due to design flexibility, small sizes, large surface-to-volume ratio, and ease of surface modification with multivalent ligands to increase avidity for target molecules. Nanomaterials can be engineered to interact with specific biological components, allowing them to benefit from the insights provided by personalized medicine techniques. To tailor these interactions, a comprehensive knowledge of how nanomaterials interact with biological systems is critical. Herein, we discuss how the interactions of nanomaterials with biological systems can guide their design for diagnostic, imaging and drug delivery purposes. A general overview of nanomaterials under investigation is provided with an emphasis on systems that have reached clinical trials.

Lipid-based vectors hold the most promising position among non-viral vectors, as they have a similar structure to cell or organelle membranes. But when used in the form of liposomes, these vectors have shown some problems. Therefore, either the nature of lipids themselves or forms used should be improved. As a novel class of lipid like materials, lipidoids have the advantages of easy synthesis and the ability for delivering siRNA to obtain excellent silencing activity. However, the toxicities of lipidoids have not been thoroughly studied. pH responsive lipids have also gained great attention recently, though some of the amine-based lipids are not novel in terms of chemical structures. More complex self-assembly structures, such as LPD (LPH) and LCP, may provide a good solution to siRNA delivery.

Viral DNA packaging motors are mainly composed of the connector channel and two DNA packaging enzymes. In 1998, it was proposed that viral DNA packaging motors exercise a mechanism similar to the action of AAA+ ATPases that assemble into ring-shaped oligomers, often hexamers, with a central channel (Guo et al. Molecular Cell, 2:149). This chapter focuses on the most recent findings in the bacteriophage varphi29 DNA packaging nanomotor to address this intriguing notion. Almost all dsDNA viruses are composed entirely of protein, but in the unique case of varphi29, packaging RNA (pRNA) plays an intermediate role in the packaging process. Evidence revealed that DNA packaging is accomplished via a &quot;push through one-way valve&quot; mechanism. The ATPase gp16 pushes dsDNA through the connector channel section by section into the procapsid. The dodecameric connector channel functions as a one-way valve that only allows dsDNA to enter but not exit the procapsid during DNA packaging. Although the roles of the ATPase gp16 and the motor connector channel are separate and independent, pRNA bridges these two components to ensure the coordination of an integrated motor. ATP induces a conformational change in gp16, leading to its stronger binding to dsDNA. Furthermore, ATP hydrolysis led to the departure of dsDNA from the ATPase/dsDNA complex, an action used to push dsDNA through the connector channel. It was found unexpectedly that by mutating the basic lysine rings of the connector channel or by changing the pH did not measurably impair DNA translocation or affect the one-way traffic property of the channel, suggesting that the positive charges in the lysine ring are not essential in gearing the dsDNA. The motor channel exercises three discrete, reversible, and controllable steps of gating, with each step altering the channel size by 31% to control the direction of translocation of dsDNA. Many DNA packaging models have been contingent upon the number of base pairs packaged per ATP relative to helical turns for B-type DNA. Both 2 and 2.5bp per ATP have been used to argue for four, five, or six discrete steps of DNA translocation. The &quot;push through one-way valve&quot; mechanism renews the perception of dsDNA packaging energy calculations and provides insight into the discrepancy between 2 and 2.5bp per ATP. Application of the DNA packaging motor in nanotechnology and nanomedicine is also addressed. Comparison with nine other DNA packaging models revealed that the &quot;push through one-way valve&quot; is the most agreeable mechanism to interpret most of the findings that led to historical models. The application of viral DNA packaging motors is also discussed.</abstract><notes>Zhang, Hui; Schwartz, Chad; De Donatis, Gian Marco; Guo, Peixuan; Adv Virus Res. 2012;83:415-65.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22748815</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/B978-0-12-394438-2.00009-8</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1164</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1164</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, H.</author><author>Dunphy, D.

Through combined spectroscopic and physical analyses, we have determined the state of aggregation, hydroxyl concentration, relative proportion of strained and unstrained siloxane rings, and potential to generate hydroxyl radicals for Stober and fumed silica NPs with comparable primary particle sizes (16 nm in diameter). On the basis of erythrocyte hemolytic assays and assessment of the viability and ATP levels in epithelial and macrophage cells, we discovered for fumed silica an important toxicity relationship to postsynthesis thermal annealing or environmental exposure, whereas colloidal silicas were essentially nontoxic under identical treatment conditions. Specifically, we find for fumed silica a positive correlation of toxicity with hydroxyl concentration and its potential to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause red blood cell hemolysis. We propose fumed silica toxicity stems from its intrinsic population of strained three-membered rings (3MRs) along with its chainlike aggregation and hydroxyl content. Hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions of the silanol surfaces of fumed silica aggregates with the extracellular plasma membrane cause membrane perturbations sensed by the Nalp3 inflammasome, whose subsequent activation leads to secretion of the cytokine IL-1beta. Hydroxyl radicals generated by the strained 3MRs in fumed silica, but largely absent in colloidal silicas, may contribute to the inflammasome activation. Formation of colloidal silica into aggregates mimicking those of fumed silica had no effect on cell viability or hemolysis. This study emphasizes that not all amorphous silicas are created equal and that the unusual toxicity of fumed silica compared to that of colloidal silica derives from its framework and surface chemistry along with its fused chainlike morphology established by high-temperature synthesis (&gt;1300 degrees C) and rapid thermal quenching.</abstract><notes>Zhang, Haiyuan&#xD;Dunphy, Darren R&#xD;Jiang, Xingmao&#xD;Meng, Huan&#xD;Sun, Bingbing&#xD;Tarn, Derrick&#xD;Xue, Min&#xD;Wang, Xiang&#xD;Lin, Sijie&#xD;Ji, Zhaoxia&#xD;Li, Ruibin&#xD;Garcia, Fred L&#xD;Yang, Jing&#xD;Kirk, Martin L&#xD;Xia, Tian&#xD;Zink, Jeffrey I&#xD;Nel, Andre&#xD;Brinker, C Jeffrey&#xD;U01 CA151792/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;J Am Chem Soc. 2012 Sep 26;134(38):15790-804.

This platform combines excellent control of valve-based microfluidics with the high-throughput capability of droplet microfluidics. We demonstrate the functioning of a proof-of-concept device which generates combinatorial mixture droplets from a linear array of sample plugs and four different reagents, using food dyes to mimic samples and reagents. Generation of a one dimensional array of the combinatorial mixture droplets on the device leads to automatic spatial indexing of these droplets, precluding the need to include a barcode in each droplet to identify its contents.

The development of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs, originally gold nanoparticles functionalized with synthetic oligonucleotides) has resulted in a powerful set of constructs that are able to efficiently transfect cells and regulate gene expression without the use of auxiliary cationic cocarriers. The gold core in such structures is primarily used as a template to arrange the nucleic acids into a densely packed and highly oriented form. In this work, we have developed methodology for coating the gold particle with a shell of silica, modifying the silica with a layer of oligonucleotides, and subsequently oxidatively dissolving the gold core with I(2). The resulting hollow silica-based SNAs exhibit cooperative binding behavior with respect to complementary oligonucleotides and cellular uptake properties comparable to their gold-core SNA counterparts. Importantly, they exhibit no cytotoxicity and have been used to effectively silence the eGFP gene in mouse endothelial cells through an antisense approach.</abstract><notes>Young, Kaylie L&#xD;Scott, Alexander W&#xD;Hao, Liangliang&#xD;Mirkin, Sarah E&#xD;Liu, Guoliang&#xD;Mirkin, Chad A&#xD;3U54CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01AR060810/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/&#xD;R21AR062898/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Nano Lett. 2012 Jul 11;12(7):3867-71.

However, complete eradication of tumor cells with PTA is difficult because of uneven heat distribution in the treatment volume. We hypothesized that combining PTA with chemotherapy using a single multifunctional nanoconstruct that mediates simultaneous photothermal cell killing and drug release (photothermal-chemotherapy) would result in enhanced antitumor activity and reduced toxicity compared to chemotherapy alone. Doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded to hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNS) coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of both DOX and HAuNS in the resulting nanoconstruct, DOX@PEG-HAuNS having different DOX:PEG:HAuNS ratios, were evaluated using dual isotope labeling techniques. The antitumor activity of DOX@PEG-HAuNS with DOX:PEG:HAuNS weight ratio of 1:3:1 (NP3) in combination with NIR laser was studied in vitro and in vivo using human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and A2780 ovarian cancer cells. In vitro, NP3 mediated PTA of both cancer cells and DOX release upon NIR laser treatment. In vivo, NP3 showed slower clearance in blood and greater accumulation in tumors than free DOX. NP3-plus-NIR laser demonstrated greater antitumor activity than free DOX, NP3, or liposomal DOX. Moreover, NP3 displayed significantly decreased systemic toxicity compared to free DOX or liposomal DOX. Enhanced antitumor effect with NP3-plus-laser can be attributed to both the cytotoxic effect of DOX released from NP3 and the photothermal effect mediated by HAuNS.

However, complete tumor eradication by PTA therapy alone is difficult because heterogeneous heat distribution can lead to sublethal thermal dose in some areas of the tumor. Successful PTA therapy requires selective delivery of photothermal conducting nanoparticles to mediate effective PTA of tumor cells, and the ability to combine PTA with other therapy modalities. Here, we synthesized multifunctional doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded hollow gold nanospheres (DOX@HAuNS) that target EphB4, a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases overexpressed on the cell membrane of multiple tumors and angiogenic blood vessels. Increased uptake of targeted nanoparticles T-DOX@HAuNS was observed in three EphB4-positive tumors both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo release of DOX from DOX@HAuNS, triggered by NIR laser, was confirmed by dual-radiotracer technique. Treatment with T-DOX@HAuNS followed by NIR laser irradiation resulted in significantly decreased tumor growth when compared with treatments with nontargeted DOX@HAuNS plus laser or HAuNS plus laser. The tumors in 6 of the 8 mice treated with T-DOX@HAuNS plus laser regressed completely with only residual scar tissue by 22 days following injection, and none of the treatment groups experienced a loss in body weight. Together, our findings show that concerted chemo-photothermal therapy with a single nanodevice capable of mediating simultaneous PTA and local drug release may have promise as a new anticancer therapy.</abstract><notes>You, Jian&#xD;Zhang, Rui&#xD;Xiong, Chiyi&#xD;Zhong, Meng&#xD;Melancon, Maritess&#xD;Gupta, Sanjay&#xD;Nick, Alpa M&#xD;Sood, Anil K&#xD;Li, Chun&#xD;CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;RC2 GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Cancer Res. 2012 Sep 15;72(18):4777-86. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1003.

Exploring new biological targets, specifically those overexpressed in stroma cells, holds significant potential for the design of specific nanocarriers to attain homing of therapeutic and imaging agents to the tumor. In clinical specimens of pancreatic cancer, we found increased expression of CD59 in tumor associated endothelial cells as well as infiltrating cells in the stroma as compared to uninvolved pancreas. We explored this dual targeting effect using orthotopic human pancreatic cancer in nude mice. By immunofluorescence analysis, we confirmed the increased expression of Ly6C, mouse homolog of CD59, in tumor associated endothelial cells as well as in macrophages within the stroma. We decorated the surface of porous silicon nanocarriers with Ly6C antibody. Targeted nanocarriers injected intravenously accumulated to tumor associated endothelial cells within 15min. At 4h after administration, 9.8+/-2.3% of injected dose/g tumor of the Ly6C targeting nanocarriers accumulated in the pancreatic tumors as opposed to 0.5+/-1.8% with non-targeted nanocarriers. These results suggest that Ly6C (or CD59) can serve as a novel dual target to deliver therapeutic agents to the stroma of pancreatic tumors.</abstract><notes>CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Ireland</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23000514 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1175</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1175</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yohe, S.

We consider its potential use as a drug loaded strip to provide both mechanical stability to the anastomosis, and as a means to release drug locally over prolonged periods for prevention of locoregional recurrence in colorectal cancer. Specifically, we electrospun poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) with the hydrophobic polymer dopant poly(glycerol monostearate-co-epsilon-caprolactone) (PGC-C18) and used the resultant mesh to control the release of two anticancer drugs (CPT-11 and SN-38). The increase in mesh hydrophobicity with PGC-C18 addition slows drug release both by the traditional means of drug diffusion, as well as by increasing the stability of the entrapped air layer to delay drug release. We demonstrate that superhydrophobic meshes have mechanical properties appropriate for surgical buttressing of the anastomosis, permit non-invasive assessment of mesh location and documentation of drug release via ultrasound, and release chemotherapy over a prolonged period of time (&gt;90 days) resulting in significant tumor cytotoxicity against a human colorectal cell line (HT-29).</abstract><notes>Yohe, Stefan T&#xD;Herrera, Victoria L M&#xD;Colson, Yolonda L&#xD;Grinstaff, Mark W&#xD;R01CA149561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R25 CA153955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Netherlands&#xD;J Control Release. 2012 Aug 20;162(1):92-101.

We have developed a lipid/calcium/phosphate (LCP) nanoparticle (NP) to improve siRNA delivery efficiency. The LCP NP was prepared by using microemulsion technology to form calcium/phosphate (CaP) core and further coated with cationic lipids. The final NP was grafted with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and anisamide (AA) ligand on the surface to target sigma receptor-expressing B16F10 melanoma cells. The LCP NP exhibited a 40 nm particle size, a +25 mV zeta-potential, and 91% siRNA encapsulation efficiency. After a single intravenous (i.v.) injection of antiluciferase siRNA (0.12 mg siRNA/kg) formulated in targeted LCP NP, luciferase activity in metastatic B16F10 tumor-loaded lungs decreased by 78% in C57BL/6 mice. In a therapeutic experiment, siRNA against MDM2, c-myc, and VEGF coformulated in the targeted LCP NP resulted in simultaneous silencing of the respective oncogenes in metastatic nodules. Treatment with siRNA in the targeted NP significantly reduced lung metastases (~70-80%) at a relatively low dose (0.36 mg/kg), whereas control group showed little therapeutic effect. Moreover, this targeted LCP NP significantly prolonged the mean survival time of the animals by 27.8% compared to control group without showing any toxicity at the therapeutic dose.</abstract><notes>Yang, Yang; Li, Jun; Liu, Feng; Huang, Leaf; CA129835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA149363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Mol Ther. 2012 Mar;20(3):609-15. doi: 10.1038/mt.2011.270.

To explore the potential of small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy for NSCLC, we have developed anisamide-targeted LCP to efficiently deliver siRNA into the cytoplasm of sigma receptor-expressing NSCLC cells. Targeted LCP demonstrated a 9-fold higher siRNA delivery efficiency compared to nontargeted LCP in A549 cells in vitro. To simultaneously target multiple oncogenic mechanisms, we coformulated three siRNA sequences targeting HDM2, c-myc and VEGF oncogenes, and investigated their efficacy of cell-killing in A549 and H460 cells in vitro. The results indicated that the pooled siRNA codelivered by the targeted LCP could effectively and simultaneously knock down HDM2, c-myc and VEGF expressions and significantly inhibit tumor cell growth. After iv injection of mice bearing A549 xenografted tumor with Texas Red-labeled siRNA formulated in the targeted LCP, siRNA was successfully delivered to and concentrated in the tumor cells. Repeated intravenous injections of mice with pooled siRNA formulated in the targeted LCP significantly impaired NSCLC growth in vivo (p &lt; 0.01) for both A549 and H460 tumors, demonstrating an ED(50) for the treatment of approximately 0.2 mg/kg in A549 tumors. The enhanced antitumor activity is due to the fact that the silencing of HDM2/c-myc/VEGF could inhibit tumor proliferation and angiogenesis and also simultaneously induce tumor apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that the targeted LCP is a promising vector to deliver pooled siRNA into tumors and to achieve multiple target blocking. This is potentially a valid therapeutic modality in the gene therapy of human NSCLC.</abstract><notes>Yang, Yang&#xD;Hu, Yunxia&#xD;Wang, Yuhua&#xD;Li, Jun&#xD;Liu, Feng&#xD;Huang, Leaf&#xD;R01 CA149363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Mol Pharm. 2012 Jun 22.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22686936</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3484223</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/mp300152v</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>706</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">706</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, W.</author><author>Ahmed, M.</author><author>Tasawwar, B.</author><author>Levchenko, T.</author><author>Sawant, R.

METHODS: Solitary subcutaneous R3230 mammary adenocarcinoma tumors (1.3-1.5cm) were implanted in 48 female Fischer rats. Initially, 32 tumors (n=8, each group) were randomized into four experimental groups: (a) conventional monopolar RF alone (70 degrees C for 5min), (b) IV liposomal quercetin alone (1mg/kg), (c) IV liposomal quercetin followed 24hr later with RF, and (d) no treatment. Next, 16 additional tumors were randomized into two groups (n=8, each) that received a combined RF and liposomal doxorubicin (15min post-RF, 8mg/kg) either with or without liposomal quercetin. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed using a tumor diameter of 3.0cm as the defined survival endpoint. RESULTS: Differences in endpoint survival and tumor doubling time among the groups were highly significant (P&lt;0.001). Endpoint survivals were 12.5+/-2.2days for the control group, 16.6+/-2.9days for tumors treated with RF alone, 15.5+/-2.1days for tumors treated with liposomal quercetin alone, and 22.0+/-3.9days with combined RF and quercetin. Additionally, combination quercetin/RF/doxorubicin therapy resulted in the longest survival (48.3+/-20.4days), followed by RF/doxorubicin (29.9+/-3.8days). CONCLUSIONS: IV liposomal quercetin in combination with RF ablation reduces tumor growth rates and improves animal endpoint survival. Further increases in endpoint survival can be seen by adding an additional anti-tumor adjuvant agent liposomal doxorubicin. This suggests that targeting several post-ablation processes with multi-drug nanotherapies can increase overall ablation efficacy.</abstract><notes>Yang, Wei; Ahmed, Muneeb; Tasawwar, Beenish; Levchenko, Tatynana; Sawant, Rupa R; Torchilin, Vladimir; Goldberg, S Nahum; Netherlands; J Control Release. 2012 Jun 10;160(2):239-44.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patched1 (Ptch1) expression was detected in tumor tissue microarrays of 396 patients with HCC who underwent curative surgical resection during February 2000 to December 2002. Prognostic significance was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank tests. The effects of NanoHHI alone and in combination with sorafenib were investigated on HCC cell lines. Primary HCC tumor growth and metastasis were examined in vivo using subcutaneous and orthotopic HCC xenografts in nude mice. RESULTS: Elevated expression of Ptch1 in HCC tissues was significantly related to disease recurrence, as well as a shorter time to recurrence in patients with HCC. In vitro, NanoHHI significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of HCC cell lines. NanoHHI potently suppressed in vivo tumor growth of HCC xenografts in both subcutaneous and orthotopic milieus, and in contrast to sorafenib, resulted in significant attenuation of systemic metastases in the orthotopic setting. Furthermore, NanoHHI significantly decreased the population of CD133-expressing HCC cells, which have been implicated in tumor initiation and metastases. CONCLUSION: Downstream Hh signaling has prognostic significance in patients with HCC as it predicts early recurrence. Gli inhibition through NanoHHI has profound tumor growth inhibition and antimetastatic effects in HCC models, which may provide a new strategy in the treatment of patients with HCC and prevention post-operative recurrence.</abstract><notes>Xu, Yang; Chenna, Venugopal; Hu, Chaoxin; Sun, Hai-Xiang; Khan, Mehtab; Bai, Haibo; Yang, Xin-Rong; Zhu, Qin-Feng; Sun, Yun-Fan; Maitra, Anirban; Fan, Jia; Anders, Robert A; R01 DK080736-01A2/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; R01 DK080736-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; R01 DK081417-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; R01 DK081417-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; R01 DK081417-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; R01DK080736/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; R01DK081417/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; U54 CA151838-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Mar 1;18(5):1291-302.

However, finding a safe and effective systemic delivery system is the major obstacle in this area. Although viral vectors showed promise for high transfection rate, the immunogenicity associated with these systems has hindered further development. As an alternative to viral gene delivery, this review focuses on application of novel safe and effective non-condensing polymeric systems that have shown high transgene expression when administered systemically or by the oral route. Type B gelatin-based engineered nanocarriers were evaluated for passive and active tumor-targeted delivery and transfection using both reporter and therapeutic plasmid DNA. Additionally, we have shown that nanoparticles-in-microsphere oral system (NiMOS) can efficiently deliver reporter and therapeutic gene constructs in the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, there has been a significant recent interest in the use small interfering RNA (siRNA) as a therapeutic system for gene silencing. Both gelatin nanoparticles and NiMOS have shown activity in systemic and oral delivery of siRNA, respectively.</abstract><notes>Xu, Jing; Ganesh, Shanthi; Amiji, Mansoor; R01 CA095522-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA095522-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA095522-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 DK080477-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; R01 DK080477-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; R01 DK080477-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; R01 DK080477-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; R01-CA95522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01-DK080477/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; Netherlands; Int J Pharm. 2012 May 1;427(1):21-34.

Urgent need exists to develop novel clinically-translatable therapeutic strategies that can improve on the dismal survival statistics of pancreatic cancer patients. Although gene therapy in cancer has shown a tremendous promise, the major challenge is in the development of safe and effective delivery system, which can lead to sustained transgene expression. Gelatin is one of the most versatile natural biopolymer, widely used in food and pharmaceutical products. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that type B gelatin could physical encapsulate DNA, which preserved the supercoiled structure of the plasmid and improved transfection efficiency upon intracellular delivery. By thiolation of gelatin, the sulfhydryl groups could be introduced into the polymer and would form disulfide bond within nanoparticles, which stabilizes the whole complex and once disulfide bond is broken due to the presence of glutathione in cytosol, payload would be released (2-5). Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modified GENS, when administered into the systemic circulation, provides long-circulation times and preferentially targets to the tumor mass due to the hyper-permeability of the neovasculature by the enhanced permeability and retention effect (6). Studies have shown over-expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on Panc-1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (7). In order to actively target pancreatic cancer cell line, EGFR specific peptide was conjugated on the particle surface through a PEG spacer.(8) Most anti-tumor gene therapies are focused on administration of the tumor suppressor genes, such as wild-type p53 (wt-p53), to restore the pro-apoptotic function in the cells (9). The p53 mechanism functions as a critical signaling pathway in cell growth, which regulates apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, metabolism and other processes (10). In pancreatic cancer, most cells have mutations in p53 protein, causing the loss of apoptotic activity. With the introduction of wt-p53, the apoptosis could be repaired and further triggers cell death in cancer cells (11). Based on the above rationale, we have designed EGFR targeting peptide-modified thiolated gelatin nanoparticles for wt-p53 gene delivery and evaluated delivery efficiency and transfection in Panc-1 cells.</abstract><notes>Xu, Jing; Amiji, Mansoor; U54-CA151881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Vis Exp. 2012 Jan 4;(59):e3612. doi: 10.3791/3612.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Video-Audio Media</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22231028</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.3791/3612</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1293</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1293</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xiong, L.</author><author>Shuhendler, A.

These issues can be tackled by using imaging probes that emit in the near-infrared wavelength range. Here we describe self-luminescing near-infrared-emitting nanoparticles employing an energy transfer relay that integrates bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, enabling in vivo near-infrared imaging without external light excitation. Nanoparticles were 30-40 nm in diameter, contained no toxic metals, exhibited long circulation time and high serum stability, and produced strong near-infrared emission. Using these nanoparticles, we successfully imaged lymphatic networks and vasculature of xenografted tumours in living mice. The self-luminescing feature provided excellent tumour-to-background ratio (&gt;100) for imaging very small tumours (2-3 mm in diameter). Our results demonstrate that these new nanoparticles are well suited to in vivo imaging applications such as lymph-node mapping and cancer imaging.</abstract><notes>Xiong, Liqin&#xD;Shuhendler, Adam J&#xD;Rao, Jianghong&#xD;England&#xD;Nat Commun. 2012 Nov 13;3:1193. doi: 10.1038/ncomms2197.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23149738</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncomms2197</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>953</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">953</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xing, H.; Wong, N.

The extremely slow growth rate of the causative pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), however, makes this challenging at the point of care, particularly in resource-limited settings. Here we report the use of BlaC (an enzyme naturally expressed/secreted by tubercle bacilli) as a marker and the design of BlaC-specific fluorogenic substrates as probes for Mtb detection. These probes showed an enhancement by 100-200 times in fluorescence emission on BlaC activation and a greater than 1,000-fold selectivity for BlaC over TEM-1 beta-lactamase, an important factor in reducing false-positive diagnoses. Insight into the BlaC specificity was revealed by successful co-crystallization of the probe/enzyme mutant complex. A refined green fluorescent probe (CDG-OMe) enabled the successful detection of live pathogen in less than ten minutes, even in unprocessed human sputum. This system offers the opportunity for the rapid, accurate detection of very low numbers of Mtb for the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis in sputum and other specimens.</abstract><notes>Xie, Hexin&#xD;Mire, Joseph&#xD;Kong, Ying&#xD;Chang, MiHee&#xD;Hassounah, Hany A&#xD;Thornton, Chris N&#xD;Sacchettini, James C&#xD;Cirillo, Jeffrey D&#xD;Rao, Jianghong&#xD;P01 68135/PHS HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Nat Chem. 2012 Oct;4(10):802-9. doi: 10.1038/nchem.1435.

We present thermal maps obtained via magnetic resonance imaging characterizing laser heating of a phantom tissue containing a multiwalled carbon nanotube inclusion. The data demonstrate that heating continuously over tens of seconds leads to poor localization ( approximately 0.5 cm) of the elevated temperature region. By contrast, for the same energy input, heat localization can be reduced to the millimeter rather than centimeter range by increasing the laser power and shortening the pulse duration. The experimental data can be well understood within a simple diffusive heat conduction model. Analysis of the model indicates that to achieve 1 mm or better resolution, heating pulses of approximately 2 s or less need to be used with appropriately higher heating power. Modeling these data using a diffusive heat conduction analysis predicts parameters for optimal targeted delivery of heat for ablative therapy.</abstract><notes>Xie, Bin&#xD;Singh, Ravi&#xD;Torti, F M&#xD;Keblinski, Pawel&#xD;Torti, Suzy&#xD;K99 CA154006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;K99CA154006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA128428/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01CA12842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01CA128428-02S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;T32 CA079448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;T32CA079448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Phys Med Biol. 2012 Sep 21;57(18):5765-75. doi: 10.1088/0031-9155/57/18/5765.

Using prostate cancer (PCa) as a model disease, we developed a cell-uptake selection strategy to isolate PCa-specific internalizing 2&apos;-O-methyl RNA aptamers (Apts) for NP incorporation. Twelve cycles of selection and counter-selection were done to obtain a panel of internalizing Apts, which can distinguish PCa cells from nonprostate and normal prostate cells. After Apt characterization, size minimization, and conjugation of the Apts with fluorescently labeled polymeric NPs, the NP-Apt conjugates exhibit PCa specificity and enhancement in cellular uptake when compared to nontargeted NPs lacking the internalizing Apts. Furthermore, when docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent used for the treatment of PCa, was encapsulated within the NP-Apt, a significant improvement in cytotoxicity was achieved in targeted PCa cells. Rather than isolating high-affinity Apts as reported in previous selection processes, our selection strategy was designed to enrich cancer cell-specific internalizing Apts. A similar cell-uptake selection strategy may be used to develop specific internalizing ligands for a myriad of other diseases and can potentially facilitate delivering various molecules, including drugs and siRNAs, into target cells.</abstract><notes>Xiao, Zeyu; Levy-Nissenbaum, Etgar; Alexis, Frank; Luptak, Andrej; Teply, Benjamin A; Chan, Juliana M; Shi, Jinjun; Digga, Elise; Cheng, Judy; Langer, Robert; Farokhzad, Omid C; CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB003647/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; K08 EB003647/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; U54 CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2012 Jan 24;6(1):696-704.

In this study, we investigated the structure-property effects of conjugating various hydrophobic biocompatible side chains to poly(glycerol-co-caprolactone) copolymers with the goal of achieving prolonged and controlled release of a chemotherapeutic agent. The choice of side chain significantly affected the resulting polymer properties including thermal transitions, relative crystallinity (DeltaH(f)), and hydrophobicity. Drug-loaded films cast from solutions of polymer and 10-hydroxycamptothecin demonstrated prolonged release from four to over seven weeks depending upon side chain structure without initial burst release behavior. Use of the stearic acid-conjugated poly(glycerol-co-caprolactone) films afforded substantial anticancer activity in vitro for at least 50 days when exposed to fresh cultures of A549 human lung cancer cells over 24 h intervals, correlating well with the measured drug release kinetics.</abstract><notes>Wolinsky, Jesse B; Yohe, Stefan T; Colson, Yolonda L; Grinstaff, Mark W; R01CA149561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R25 CA153955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Biomacromolecules. 2012 Feb 13;13(2):406-11.

These localized therapies exist in a variety of form factors designed to facilitate the delivery of drug directly to the site of disease in a controlled manner, sparing off-target tissue toxicities. Many of these depots are biodegradable and designed to maintain therapeutic concentrations of drug at the tumor site for a prolonged period of time. Thus a single implantation procedure is required, sometimes coincident with tumor excision surgery, and thereby biodegrading following complete release of the loaded active agent. Even though localized polymer depot delivery systems have been investigated, a surprisingly small subset of these technologies has demonstrated potentially curative preclinical results for cancer applications, and fewer have progressed toward commercialization. The aims of this article are to review the most well-studied and efficacious local polymer delivery systems from the last two decades, to examine the rationale for utilizing drug-eluting polymer implants in cancer patients, and to identify the patient cohorts that could most benefit from localized therapy. Finally, a discussion of the physiological barriers to localized therapy (i.e. drug penetration, transport), technical hurdles, and future outlook of the field is presented.</abstract><notes>Wolinsky, Jesse B; Colson, Yolonda L; Grinstaff, Mark W; R25 CA153955./CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Netherlands; J Control Release. 2012 Apr 10;159(1):14-26.

We report here the design and synthesis of a compact and water-soluble zwitterionic dopamine sulfonate (ZDS) ligand with strong binding affinity to SPIONs. After ligand exchange, the ZDS-coated SPIONs exhibit small hydrodynamic diameters, and stability with respect to time, pH, and salinity.

The methods capable of in vivo application are extremely limited. The hypothesis investigated by the authors was that the relaxation time could be measured quantitatively using magnetic spectroscopy of nanoparticle Brownian motion (MSB). METHODS: The MSB signal (1) reflects the nanoparticle rotational Brownian motion, (2) can be measured from very low nanoparticle concentrations, and (3) is a function of the product of the drive frequency and the relaxation time characterizing Brownian motion. To estimate the relaxation time, the MSB signal was measured at several frequencies. The MSB signal for nanoparticles with altered relaxation time is a scaled version of that for reference nanoparticles with a known relaxation time. The scaling factor linking the altered and reference MSB measurements is the same factor linking the altered and reference relaxation times. The method was tested using glycerol solutions of varying viscosities to obtain continuously variable relaxation times. RESULTS: The measured relaxation time increased with increasing viscosity of the solution in which the nanoparticles resided. The MSB estimated relaxation time matched the calculated relaxation times based on viscosity with 2% average error. CONCLUSIONS: MSB can be used to monitor the nanoparticle relaxation time quantitatively through a scale space correlation of the MSB signal as a function of frequency.</abstract><notes>Weaver, John B&#xD;Kuehlert, Esra&#xD;1U54CA151662-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Med Phys. 2012 May;39(5):2765-70.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22559648</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3350541</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1118/1.3701775</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1317</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1317</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weaver, J.

A method termed magnetic spectroscopy of nanoparticle Brownian motion (MSB) was developed to interrogate in vivo the microscopic environment surrounding magnetic nanoparticles. We can monitor several effects that are important in thermal therapy and screening including temperature measurement and the bound state distribution. Here we report on simulations of nanoparticle localization. Measuring the spatial distribution of nanoparticles would allow us to identify ovarian cancer much earlier when it is still curable or monitor thermal therapies more accurately. We demonstrate that with well-designed equipment superior signal to noise ratio (SNR) can be achieved using only two harmonics rather than using all the harmonics containing signal. Alternatively, smaller magnetic field amplitudes can be used to achieve the same SNR. The SNR is improved using fewer harmonics because the noise is limited.</abstract><notes>Weaver, John B&#xD;J Appl Phys. 2012 Apr 1;111(7):7B317-7B3173.

The MSB signal is sensitive to chemical binding, temperature and viscosity. If the MSB signals from nanoparticles in multiple bound states are known, a mixture model can be used to find the concentration of nanoparticles in each bound state. The accuracy has been shown to be high for two and three bound states. However, if the bound states are not accurately known, as is often the case in vivo, the model is perturbed significantly. Using simulations of two bound states based on the effective field approximation to the Fokker-Planck equations, we show that the error in the bound fraction is roughly proportional to the error in the bound state relaxation time. The errors in bound fraction were roughly proportional to the error in the relaxation time for the bound state used in the mixture model. The largest errors occurred for short relaxation time bound states. But for all bound state relaxation times, 10% errors in the relaxation time of the bound state resulted in errors in the bound fraction of less than 10%.</abstract><notes>10.1117/12.915162</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.915162</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.915162</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1316</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1316</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weaver, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Alternative spatial encoding for imaging magnetic nanoparticles (Proceedings Paper)</title><secondary-title>Proc SPIE</secondary-title></titles><volume>8317</volume><dates><year>2012</year></dates><urls><related-urls><url>http://spie.org/x648.html?product_id=913926</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.913926</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1089</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1089</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Y.</author><author>Byrne, J.

Complete control over particle characteristics, such as size, shape, mechanical property, and surface chemistry, can enable rapid translation and facilitate the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of particle technologies for the treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, diabetes, and a host of other major illnesses. The incorporation of natural and artificial external stimuli to trigger the release of drugs enables exquisite control over the release profiles of drugs in a given environment. In this article, we examine several readily scalable top-down methods for the fabrication of shape-specific particles that utilize stimuli-responsive biomaterials for controlled drug delivery.

A microfluidic system was used for highly parallel sample processing and to minimize nonspecific amplification. High-density genotyping results from 91 single cells were used to create a personal recombination map, which was consistent with population-wide data at low resolution but revealed significant differences from pedigree data at higher resolution.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The antitumor efficacy of XMT-1001 was evaluated in the mouse HT-29 human colon carcinoma xenograft model. XMT-1001 was administered intravenously to female athymic nude (nu/nu) mice bearing established HT-29 xenograft tumors (n = 10) at 15, 30, and 60 mg CPT equivalents/kg on weekly or biweekly schedules. The tumor growth inhibition and tumor growth delay endpoints were used for efficacy evaluation. In the pharmacokinetic study, XMT-1001 was administered intravenously at a pharmacologically relevant dose of 60 mg CPT equivalents/kg x 1 via tail vein or an equimolar dose of CPT-11 at 100 mg/kg i.p. x 1. Mice (n = 3 per time point) were euthanized from 0.083 to 336 hours after XMT-1001 administration and from 0.083 to 24 hours after CPT-11. Plasma, tumor, and tissues were collected from all animals. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay was used to measure XMT-1001, conjugate release products, CPT-20-O-(N-succinimido-glycinate; CPT-SI) and CPT-20-O-(N-succinamidoyl-glycinate; CPT-SA), and CPT. RESULTS: After XMT-1001 administration, the majority of the plasma exposure is accounted for by conjugated CPT. XMT-1001 exhibited a prolonged exposure of conjugated drug, active conjugate primary release products, CPT-SI and CPT-SA, and active CPT, which was associated with greater antitumor response compared with CPT-11. CONCLUSIONS: XMT-1001 provides an extended systemic and tumor exposure of conjugated drug and shows improved antitumor effect compared with CPT-11.</abstract><notes>Walsh, Mark D; Hanna, Suzan K; Sen, Jeremy; Rawal, Sumit; Cabral, Carolina B; Yurkovetskiy, Alex V; Fram, Robert J; Lowinger, Timothy B; Zamboni, William C; Clin Cancer Res. 2012 May 1;18(9):2591-602.

In this tutorial review, we summarize the latest progress on designing silica-based nanoprobes for imaging and theranostic applications. The synthesis of both solid silica and mesoporous silica nanoparticles is described, along with different approaches used for surface functionalization. Special emphasis is placed on the application of silica-based nanoprobes in optical, magnetic resonance, and multimodal imaging.

Graphene-Al(2)O(3) nanolaminate membranes are formed by sequentially depositing layers of graphene and Al(2)O(3), with nanopores being formed in these membranes using an electron-beam sculpting process. The resulting nanopores are highly robust, exhibit low electrical noise (significantly lower than nanopores in pure graphene), are highly sensitive to electrolyte pH at low KCl concentrations (attributed to the high buffer capacity of Al(2)O(3)), and permit the electrical biasing of the embedded graphene electrode, thereby allowing for three terminal nanopore measurements. In proof-of-principle biomolecule sensing experiments, the folded and unfolded transport of single DNA molecules and RecA-coated DNA complexes could be discerned with high temporal resolution. The process described here also enables nanopore integration with new graphene-based structures, including nanoribbons and nanogaps, for single-molecule DNA sequencing and medical diagnostic applications.</abstract><notes>Venkatesan, Bala Murali; Estrada, David; Banerjee, Shouvik; Jin, Xiaozhong; Dorgan, Vincent E; Bae, Myung-Ho; Aluru, Narayana R; Pop, Eric; Bashir, Rashid; R21 CA155863/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R25 CA154015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2012 Jan 24;6(1):441-50.

This limits their size to about 100nm. Here, using intravital microscopy and elemental analysis, we compare the in vivo localization of particles with different geometries and demonstrate that plateloid particles preferentially accumulate within the tumor vasculature at unprecedented levels, independent of the EPR effect. In melanoma-bearing mice, 1000x400nm plateloid particles adhered to the tumor vasculature at about 5% and 10% of the injected dose per gram organ (ID/g) for untargeted and RGD-targeted particles respectively, and exhibited the highest tumor-to-liver accumulation ratios (0.22 and 0.35). Smaller and larger plateloid particles, as well as cylindroid particles, were more extensively sequestered by the liver, spleen, and lungs. Plateloid particles appeared well-suited for taking advantage of hydrodynamic forces and interfacial interactions required for efficient tumoritropic accumulation, even without using specific targeting ligands.</abstract><notes>van de Ven, Anne L; Kim, Pilhan; Haley, O&apos;Hara; Fakhoury, Jean R; Adriani, Giulia; Schmulen, Jeffrey; Moloney, Padraig; Hussain, Fazle; Ferrari, Mauro; Liu, Xuewu; Yun, Seok-Hyun; Decuzzi, Paolo; U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Netherlands; J Control Release. 2012 Feb 28;158(1):148-55.

Many systems use water as a coupling medium between the scanned object and the ultrasound transducers. Prior to a scan, the water is heated to body temperature to enable small animal imaging. During the scan, the water heating system of some systems is switched off to minimize the risk of bubble formation, which leads to a gradual decrease in water temperature and hence the speed of sound. In this work, we use a commercially available scanner that follows this procedure, and show that a failure to model intra-scan temperature decreases as small as 1.5 degrees C leads to image artifacts that may be difficult to distinguish from true structures, particularly in complex scenes. We then improve image quality by continuously monitoring the water temperature during the scan and applying variable speed of sound corrections in the image reconstruction algorithm. While upgrading to an air bubble-free heating pump and keeping it running during the scan could also solve the changing temperature problem, we show that a software correction for the temperature changes provides a cost-effective alternative to a hardware upgrade. The efficacy of the software corrections was shown to be consistent across objects of widely varying appearances, namely physical phantoms, ex vivo tissue, and in vivo mouse imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the efficacy of modeling temporal variations in the speed of sound during photoacoustic scans, as opposed to spatial variations as focused on by previous studies. Since air bubbles pose a common problem in ultrasonic and photoacoustic imaging systems, our results will be useful to future small animal imaging studies that use scanners with similarly limited heating units.</abstract><notes>P50CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23071512 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1442</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1442</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Valencia, P.

In this work, the authors report the use of targeted polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) to coencapsulate and deliver I&amp;C to cancer cells expressing the prostate-specific membrane antigen. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: Targeted NPs were prepared in a single step by mixing four different precursors inside microfluidic devices. RESULTS: I&amp;C were encapsulated in 55-nm NPs and showed an eightfold increase in internalization by prostate-specific membrane antigen-expressing LNCaP cells compared with nontargeted NPs. NPs coencapsulating both drugs exhibited strong synergism in LNCaP cells with a combination index of 0.2.

However, their translation into the clinic has been slow because it remains difficult to produce nanoparticles that are consistent &apos;batch-to-batch&apos;, and in sufficient quantities for clinical research. Moreover, platforms for rapid screening of nanoparticles are still lacking. Recent microfluidic technologies can tackle some of these issues, and offer a way to accelerate the clinical translation of nanoparticles. In this Progress Article, we highlight the advances in microfluidic systems that can synthesize libraries of nanoparticles in a well-controlled, reproducible and high-throughput manner. We also discuss the use of microfluidics for rapidly evaluating nanoparticles in vitro under microenvironments that mimic the in vivo conditions. Furthermore, we highlight some systems that can manipulate small organisms, which could be used for evaluating the in vivo toxicity of nanoparticles or for drug screening. We conclude with a critical assessment of the near- and long-term impact of microfluidics in the field of nanomedicine.</abstract><notes>HHSN268201000045C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;HHSN268201000045C/PHS HHS/United States&#xD;U54-CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;Review&#xD;England</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23042546 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1319</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1319</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Uckun, FM.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>siRNA Carrying Targeted Nanoparticles as a New Class of Rationally-&#xD;Designed Anti-Cancer Therapeutics</title><secondary-title>Nanomedicine &amp; Biotherapeutic Discovery</secondary-title></titles><volume>2</volume><number>3</number><dates><year>2012</year></dates><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.omicsonline.org/2155-983X/2155-983X-2-e112.php</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.4172/2155-983X.1000e112</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1245</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1245</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tucker, A.</author><author>Qian, X.</author><author>Gidcumb, E.</author><author>Spronk, D.</author><author>Sprenger, F.</author><author>Kuo, J.</author><author>Ng, S.</author><author>Lu, J.</author><author>Zhou, O.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Optimizing configuration parameters of a stationary digital breast tomosynthesis system based on carbon nanotube x-ray sources</title><secondary-title>Proc SPIE</secondary-title></titles><pages>831307-831307</pages><dates><year>2012</year></dates><abstract>The stationary Digital Breast Tomosynthesis System (s-DBT) has the advantage over the conventional DBT systems as there is no motion blurring in the projection images associated with the x-ray source motion. We have developed a prototype s-DBT system by retrofitting a Hologic Selenia Dimensions rotating gantry tomosynthesis system with a distributed carbon nanotube (CNT) x-ray source array. The linear array consists of 31 x-ray generating focal spots distributed over a 30 degree angle. Each x-ray beam can be electronically activated allowing the flexibility and easy implementation of novel tomosynthesis scanning with different scanning parameters and configurations. Here we report the initial results of investigation on the imaging quality of the s-DBT system and its dependence on the acquisition parameters including the number of projections views, the total angular span of the projection views, the dose distribution between different projections, and the total dose. A mammography phantom is used to visually assess image quality. The modulation transfer function (MTF) of a line wire phantom is used to evaluate the system spatial resolution. For s-DBT the in-plan system resolution, as measured by the MTF, does not change for different configurations. This is in contrast to rotating gantry DBT systems, where the MTF degrades for increased angular span due to increased focal spot blurring associated with the x-ray source motion. The overall image quality factor, a composite measure of the signal difference to noise ratio (SdNR) for mass detection and the z-axis artifact spread function for microcalcification detection, is best for the configuration with a large angular span, an intermediate number of projection views, and an even dose distribution. These results suggest possible directions for further improvement of s-DBT systems for high quality breast cancer imaging.</abstract><notes>10.1117/12.911530</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.911530</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.911530</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>963</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">963</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tong, Z.</author><author>Balzer, E.

Current in vitro cell motility assays suffer from various drawbacks, including insufficient temporal and/or optical resolution, or the failure to include a controlled chemotactic stimulus. Here, we address these limitations with a migration chamber that utilizes a self-sustaining chemotactic gradient to induce locomotion through confined environments that emulate physiological settings. Dynamic real-time analysis of both population-scale and single-cell movement are achieved at high resolution. Interior surfaces can be functionalized through adsorption of extracellular matrix components, and pharmacological agents can be administered to cells directly, or indirectly through the chemotactic reservoir. Direct comparison of multiple cell types can be achieved in a single enclosed system to compare inherent migratory potentials. Our novel microfluidic design is therefore a powerful tool for the study of cellular chemotaxis, and is suitable for a wide range of biological and biomedical applications.</abstract><notes>Tong, Ziqiu; Balzer, Eric M; Dallas, Matthew R; Hung, Wei-Chien; Stebe, Kathleen J; Konstantopoulos, Konstantinos; R01-CA101135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32-CA130840/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54-CA143868/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e29211.

However, the detector sensitivity and chemical noise compromise the detection of many invaluable low-abundance molecules from biological and clinical samples. To challenge this limitation, we developed a targeted analyte detection (TAD) technique. In TAD, the target analyte is selectively elevated by spiking a known amount of that analyte into the sample, thereby raising its concentration above the noise level, where we take advantage of the improved sensitivity to detect the presence of the endogenous analyte in the sample. We assessed TAD on three peptides in simple and complex background solutions with various exogenous analyte concentrations in two MALDI matrices. TAD successfully improved the limit of detection (LOD) of target analytes when the target peptides were added to the sample in a concentration close to optimum concentration. The optimum exogenous concentration was estimated through a quantitative method to be approximately equal to the original LOD for each target. Also, we showed that TAD could achieve LOD improvements on an average of 3-fold in a simple and 2-fold in a complex sample. TAD provides a straightforward assay to improve the LOD of generic target analytes without the need for costly hardware modifications.</abstract><notes>Toghi Eshghi, Shadi&#xD;Li, Xingde&#xD;Zhang, Hui&#xD;N01-HV-00240/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;P01HL107153/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;U01CA152813/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U24CA16003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Anal Chem. 2012 Sep 18;84(18):7626-32. doi: 10.1021/ac301423f.

However, no approaches have been adopted to do this clinically, and the current standard of care is invasive tissue biopsy. A dual-reporter methodology capable of quantifying available receptor binding potential of tumors in vivo within a clinically relevant time scale is presented. PROCEDURES: To test the methodology, a fluorescence imaging-based adaptation was validated against ex vivo and in vitro measures of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) binding potential in four tumor lines in mice, each line expected to express a different level of EGFR. RESULTS: A strong correlation was observed between in vivo and ex vivo measures of binding potential for all tumor lines (r = 0.99, p &lt; 0.01, slope = 1.80 +/- 0.48, and intercept = -0.58 +/- 0.84) and between in vivo and in vitro for the three lines expressing the least amount of EGFR (r = 0.99, p &lt; 0.01, slope = 0.64 +/- 0.32, and intercept = 0.47 +/- 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: By providing a fast and robust measure of receptor density in tumors, the presented methodology has powerful implications for improving choices in cancer intervention, evaluation, and monitoring, and can be scaled to the clinic with an imaging modality like SPECT.</abstract><notes>P01 CA084203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P01CA84201/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA156177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01CA156177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA105480/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States&#xD;MIB : the official publication of the Academy of Molecular Imaging</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=22203241 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1074</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1074</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tichauer, K.

The uptake of two fluorophores, one nonspecific and one targeted to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), were imaged at 1 h in three types of xenograft tumors spanning a range of EGFR expression levels (n=6 in each group). Using this dual-reporter imaging methodology, tumor contrast-to-noise ratio was amplified by &gt;6 times at 1 h postinjection and &gt;2 times at 24 h. Furthermore, by as early as 20 min postinjection, the dual-reporter imaging signal in the tumor correlated significantly with a validated marker of receptor density (P&lt;0.05, r=0.93).

Molecular imaging of targeted tracers can be used to quantify receptor expression in the form of a binding potential (BP) if the arterial input curve or a surrogate of it is also measured. However, the assumptions of the most common approaches (reference tissue models) may not be valid for use in tumors. In this study, the validity of reference tissue models is investigated for use in tumors experimentally and in simulations. Three different tumor lines were grown subcutaneously in athymic mice and the mice were injected with a mixture of an epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted fluorescent tracer and an untargeted fluorescent tracer. A one-compartment plasma input model demonstrated that the transport kinetics of both tracers was significantly different between tumors and all potential reference tissues, and using the reference tissue model resulted in a theoretical underestimation in BP of 50% +/- 37%. On the other hand, the targeted and untargeted tracers demonstrated similar transport kinetics, allowing a dual-tracer approach to be employed to accurately estimate BP (with a theoretical error of 0.23% +/- 9.07%). These findings highlight the potential for using a dual-tracer approach to quantify receptor expression in tumors with abnormal hemodynamics, possibly to inform the choice or progress of molecular cancer therapies.</abstract><notes>P01 CA084203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P01CA84201/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA156177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01CA156177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;England</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23022732 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1363</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1363</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tichauer, K.

However, light absorption by tissue chromophores (e.g., hemoglobin, water, lipids, melanin) typically limits optical signal propagation through thicknesses larger than a few millimeters. Compared to other visible wavelengths, tissue absorption for red and near-infrared (near-IR) light absorption dramatically decreases and non-elastic scattering becomes the dominant light-tissue interaction mechanism. The relatively recent development of fluorescent agents that absorb and emit light in the near-IR range (600-1000 nm), has driven the development of imaging systems and light propagation models that can achieve whole body three-dimensional imaging in small animals. Despite great strides in this area, the ill-posed nature of diffuse fluorescence tomography remains a significant problem for the stability, contrast recovery and spatial resolution of image reconstruction techniques and the optimal approach to FMI in small animals has yet to be agreed on. The majority of research groups have invested in charge-coupled device (CCD)-based systems that provide abundant tissue-sampling but suboptimal sensitivity, while our group and a few others have pursued systems based on very high sensitivity detectors, that at this time allow dense tissue sampling to be achieved only at the cost of low imaging throughput. Here we demonstrate the methodology for applying single-photon detection technology in a fluorescence tomography system to localize a cancerous brain lesion in a mouse model. The fluorescence tomography (FT) system employed single photon counting using photomultiplier tubes (PMT) and information-rich time-domain light detection in a non-contact conformation. This provides a simultaneous collection of transmitted excitation and emission light, and includes automatic fluorescence excitation exposure control, laser referencing, and co-registration with a small animal computed tomography (microCT) system. A nude mouse model was used for imaging. The animal was inoculated orthotopically with a human glioma cell line (U251) in the left cerebral hemisphere and imaged 2 weeks later. The tumor was made to fluoresce by injecting a fluorescent tracer, IRDye 800CW-EGF (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) targeted to epidermal growth factor receptor, a cell membrane protein known to be overexpressed in the U251 tumor line and many other cancers. A second, untargeted fluorescent tracer, Alexa Fluor 647 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) was also injected to account for non-receptor mediated effects on the uptake of the targeted tracers to provide a means of quantifying tracer binding and receptor availability/density. A CT-guided, time-domain algorithm was used to reconstruct the location of both fluorescent tracers (i.e., the location of the tumor) in the mouse brain and their ability to localize the tumor was verified by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Though demonstrated for fluorescence imaging in a glioma mouse model, the methodology presented in this video can be extended to different tumor models in various small animal models potentially up to the size of a rat.</abstract><notes>K25 CA138578/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;K25 CA138578/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA120368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA120368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA132750/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA132750/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA156177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Video-Audio Media&#xD;United States&#xD;JoVE</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=22847515 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>600</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">600</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Q.</author><author>Price, N.

Systems biology, with its holistic approach to understanding fundamental principles in biology, and the empowering technologies in genomics, proteomics, single-cell analysis, microfluidics and computational strategies, enables a comprehensive approach to medicine, which strives to unveil the pathogenic mechanisms of diseases, identify disease biomarkers and begin thinking about new strategies for drug target discovery. The integration of multidimensional high-throughput &apos;omics&apos; measurements from tumour tissues and corresponding blood specimens, together with new systems strategies for diagnostics, enables the identification of cancer biomarkers that will enable presymptomatic diagnosis, stratification of disease, assessment of disease progression, evaluation of patient response to therapy and the identification of reoccurrences. Whilst some aspects of systems medicine are being adopted in clinical oncology practice through companion molecular diagnostics for personalized therapy, the mounting influx of global quantitative data from both wellness and diseases is shaping up a transformational paradigm in medicine we termed &apos;predictive&apos;, &apos;preventive&apos;, &apos;personalized&apos;, and &apos;participatory&apos; (P4) medicine, which requires new strategies, both scientific and organizational, to enable bringing this revolution in medicine to patients and to the healthcare system. P4 medicine will have a profound impact on society - transforming the healthcare system, turning around the ever escalating costs of healthcare, digitizing the practice of medicine and creating enormous economic opportunities for those organizations and nations that embrace this revolution.</abstract><notes>Tian, Q; Price, N D; Hood, L; P50GM076547/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R00CA126184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151819-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151819A/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; J Intern Med. 2012 Feb;271(2):111-21. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2011.02498.x.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Review</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22142401</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2796.2011.02498.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1420</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1420</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thiviyanathan, V.</author><author>Gorenstein, D.

Proteomic assays need high sensitivity and specificity, a wide dynamic range for detection, and accurate, reproducible quantification with small confidence values. However, several inherent limitations of monoclonal antibodies in meeting the emerging challenges of proteomics led to the development of a new class of oligonucleotide-based reagents. Natural and derivatized nucleic acid aptamers are emerging as promising alternatives to monoclonal antibodies. Aptamers can be effectively used to simultaneously detect thousands of proteins in multiplex discovery platforms, where antibodies often fail due to cross-reactivity problems. Through chemical modification, vast range of additional functional groups can be added at any desired position in the oligonucleotide sequence, therefore the best features of small molecule drugs, proteins, and antibodies can be brought together into aptamers, making aptamers the most versatile reagent in proteomics. In this review, we discuss the recent developments in aptamer technology, including new selection methods and the aptamers&apos; application in proteomics.</abstract><notes>AI27744/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States&#xD;GM084552/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;HHSN272200800048C/PHS HHS/United States&#xD;N01-HV-28184/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;Germany</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23090891 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1109</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1109</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thanapprapasr, D.</author><author>Hu, W.</author><author>Sood, A.

Almost a half million deaths from gynecologic cancer are reported each year. Understanding the molecular biology of cancer is a principle resource leading to the identification of new potential therapeutic targets, which may be parlayed into novel therapeutic options in gynecologic cancer. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which plays a pivotal role in many aspects of malignant growth including cancer cell survival, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Various human cancer tissues have demonstrated high expression of FAK or activated FAK, which has been correlated with survival of cancer patients. Among gynecologic cancers, reports have emerged demonstrating that FAK is involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers. In addition, the polycomb group protein enhancer of Zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), Dll4/notch and EphA2 has also emerged as important regulators of endothelial cell biology and angiogenesis.

Although cancer drug development traditionally focused on targeting the tumor cell cycle, emphasis has recently shifted toward the tumor microenvironment for novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. The tumor microenvironment is a dynamic composite of cells broadly categorized as immune cells and nonimmune cells within a scaffold of extracellular matrix, where tumor cells thrive. Among the various nonimmune cell types, cancer stromal cells have emerged as critical players in promoting tumor proliferation, neovascularization, invasion, and metastasis as well as interacting with immune cells to tilt the equilibrium toward a tolerogenic environment that favors the tumor cells. In view of recent work that demonstrated that the depletion of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expressing tumor stromal cells resulted in stunted tumor growth and improved response to tumor vaccination, the tumor microenvironment is, therefore, fertile ground for development of novel therapy with the potential of augmenting existing treatment and prevention options. In this review, we will focus on current evidence supporting the role of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), with a special focus on FAP(+) stromal cells, in promoting tumor growth. The role of CAFs in promoting an immunosuppressive environment, which may accelerate tumor progression, will be discussed with the hope that therapeutics developed to target the &quot;generic&quot; tumor microenvironment may be effective for malignancies such as triple negative breast cancer, for which targeted therapy is not available to date, in the future.</abstract><notes>2-P30-CA-016520-35/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA124515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA157664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Review&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=22959023 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1168</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1168</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Taylor, R.

We report the encapsulation of superparamagnetic iron platinum nanoparticles (SIPPs) and paclitaxel in a mixture of polyethyleneglycolated, fluorescent, and biotin-functionalized phospholipids to create multifunctional SIPP-PTX micelles (SPMs) that were conjugated to an antibody against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for the specific targeting, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and treatment of human prostate cancer xenografts in mice. RESULTS: SPMs were 45.4 +/- 24.9 nm in diameter and composed of 160.7 +/- 22.9 mug/mL iron, 247.0 +/- 33.4 mug/mL platinum, and 702.6 +/- 206.0 mug/mL paclitaxel. Drug release measurements showed that, at 37 degrees C, half of the paclitaxel was released in 30.2 hours in serum and two times faster in saline. Binding assays suggested that PSMA-targeted SPMs specifically bound to C4-2 human prostate cancer cells in vitro and released paclitaxel into the cells. In vitro, paclitaxel was 2.2 and 1.6 times more cytotoxic than SPMs to C4-2 cells at 24 and 48 hours of incubation, respectively. After 72 hours of incubation, paclitaxel and SPMs were equally cytotoxic. SPMs had MRI transverse relaxivities of 389 +/- 15.5 Hz/mM iron, and SIPP micelles with and without drug caused MRI contrast enhancement in vivo. CONCLUSION: Only PSMA-targeted SPMs and paclitaxel significantly prevented growth of C4-2 prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, mice injected with PSMA-targeted SPMs showed significantly more paclitaxel and platinum in tumors, compared with nontargeted SPM-injected and paclitaxel-injected mice.</abstract><notes>Taylor, Robert M&#xD;Sillerud, Laurel O&#xD;5R01CA123194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R25CA153825/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;New Zealand&#xD;Int J Nanomedicine. 2012;7:4341-52. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S34381.

METHODS: Messenger RNA and protein expression levels for integrin alpha(nu) beta(3), neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), and prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) were measured in LNCaP, C4-2, and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines and in murine xenografts using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Stable expression patterns were observed for integrin alpha(nu) and PSMA in all cells and corresponding xenografts. Integrin beta(3) mRNA expression was greatly reduced in C4-2 xenografts and greatly elevated in PC-3 xenografts compared with the corresponding cultured cells.

The properties of these particles were determined by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxivity at 4.7 Tesla. TEM showed that the diameters of the particles ranged from 9.3 nm to 10 nm, depending on the mole ratio of iron to platinum precursors, and on the concentration of Octadecylamine (ODA) used in their preparation. The iron to platinum stoichiometry determined by ICP-OES varied from 1.4:1 to 3.7:1 and was similarly dependant on the initial mole ratios of iron and platinum salts, as well as on the concentration of ODA in the reaction. SQUID magnetometry showed that the SIPPs were superparamagnetic and had magnetic moments that increased with increasing iron content from 62 to 72 A*m(2)/kg Fe. The measured relaxivities of the SIPPs at 4.7 Tesla were higher than commercially available superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), suggesting that these particles may be superior contrast agents in T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</abstract><notes>Taylor, Robert M; Huber, Dale L; Monson, Todd C; Esch, Victor; Sillerud, Laurel O; R01 CA123194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Vac Sci Technol B Nanotechnol Microelectron. 2012 Mar;30(2):2C101-2C1016.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22872817</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3412162</custom2><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1171</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1171</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, X.</author><author>Ali, M.

Traditional micro-fabrication process is not applicable. Here we report a simple, novel and general method to pattern a variety of commonly used cell adhesion molecules, i.e. Fibronectin (FN), Laminin (LN) and Collagen I (CN), etc. on PA gels. The pattern is first printed on a hydrophilic glass using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp and micro-contact printing (muCP). Pre-polymerization solution is applied on the patterned glass and is then sandwiched by a functionalized glass slide, which covalently binds to the gel. The hydrophilic glass slide is then peeled off from the gel when the protein patterns detach from the glass, but remain intact with the gel. The pattern is thus transferred to the gel. The mechanism of pattern transfer is studied in light of interfacial mechanics. It is found that hydrophilic glass offers strong enough adhesion with ECM proteins such that a pattern can be printed, but weak enough adhesion such that they can be completely peeled off by the polymerized gel. This balance is essential for successful pattern transfer. As a demonstration, lines of FN, LN and CN with widths varying from 5-400 mum are patterned on PA gels. Normal fibroblasts (MKF) are cultured on the gel surfaces. The cell attachment and proliferation are confined within these patterns. The method avoids the use of any toxic chemistry often used to pattern different proteins on gel surfaces.</abstract><notes>Tang, Xin&#xD;Ali, M Yakut&#xD;Saif, M Taher A&#xD;R25 CA154015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Soft Matter. 2012 Jul 21;8(27):7197-7206.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23002394</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3447741</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/C2SM25533B</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>952</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">952</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, L.</author><author>Fan, T.

Accumulating evidence suggests that NPs with sizes less than 50 nm demonstrate superior performance in vitro and in vivo. However, it is difficult to fabricate monodisperse, drug-containing NPs with discrete sizes required for studying and characterizing existing relationships among particle size, biologic processing, and therapeutic functionality. Here, we report a scalable process of fabricating drug-silica conjugated nanoparticles, termed drug-silica nanoconjugates (drug-NCs), which possess monodisperse size distributions and desirable particle sizes as small as 20 nm. We find that 20 nm NCs are superior to their 50 and 200 nm NC analogues by 2-5- and 10-20-fold, respectively, with regard to tumor accumulation and penetration and cellular internalization. These fundamental findings underscore the importance and necessity of further miniaturizing nanomedicine size for optimized drug delivery applications.</abstract><notes>Tang, Li; Fan, Timothy M; Borst, Luke B; Cheng, Jianjun; 1DP2OD007246-01/OD/NIH HHS/; 1R21CA152627/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R25 CA154015A/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2012 May 22;6(5):3954-66.

In T-cell assays, both free CsA and CsA/PEG-PLGA-NPs suppressed T-cell proliferation and production of inflammatory cytokines dose dependently. In a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay, the IC(50) values for free CsA and CsA/PEG-PLGA-NPs were found to be 30 and 35 ng/mL, respectively.

In this study, we have examined the anticancer activity of PIK75 incorporated in surface functionalized nanoemulsions for targeted delivery to SKOV-3 cells. A pro-apoptotic molecule C(6)-ceramide was also co-delivered to augment therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: EGFR and FR functionalized nanoemulsions incorporating PIK75 and C(6)-ceramide were characterized for particle size, surface charge, entrapment efficiency and morphology. Fluorescence and quantitative uptake studies were conducted in SKOV-3 cells to determine intracellular distribution. Cell viability was assessed using MTT assay while mechanism of cytotoxicity was evaluated using capsase-3/7, TUNEL and hROS assay. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity assay showed 57% decrease in IC(50) value of PIK75 following treatment with EGFR targeted nanoemulsion and 40% decrease following treatment with FR targeted nanoemulsion. Combination therapy with PIK75 and ceramide enhanced the cytotoxicity of PIK75 compared to therapy with individual formulations. The increase in cytotoxicity was attributed to increase in cellular apoptosis and hROS activity. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the targeted system improved cytotoxicity of PIK75 compared to the non-targeted system. Combination therapy with ceramide augmented PIK75&apos;s therapeutic activity.</abstract><notes>Pharm Res. 2012 Jun 1.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22653667</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11095-012-0793-6</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1343</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1343</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ta, C.

The summit revealed that this field is advancing rapidly. Conventional cellular therapies, such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), are becoming more effective and more available. Gene therapy is becoming an important tool in adoptive cell therapy. Lymphocytes are being engineered to express high affinity T cell receptors (TCRs), chimeric antibody-T cell receptors (CARs) and cytokines. T cell subsets with more naive and stem cell-like characteristics have been shown in pre-clinical models to be more effective than unselected populations and it is now possible to reprogram T cells and to produce T cells with stem cell characteristics. In the future, combinations of adoptive transfer of T cells and specific vaccination against the cognate antigen can be envisaged to further enhance the effectiveness of these therapies.</abstract><notes>Stroncek, David F&#xD;Berger, Carolina&#xD;Cheever, Martin A&#xD;Childs, Richard W&#xD;Dudley, Mark E&#xD;Flynn, Peter&#xD;Gattinoni, Luca&#xD;Heath, James R&#xD;Kalos, Michael&#xD;Marincola, Francesco M&#xD;Miller, Jeffrey S&#xD;Mostoslavsky, Gustavo&#xD;Powell, Daniel J Jr&#xD;Rao, Mahendra&#xD;Restifo, Nicholas P&#xD;Rosenberg, Steven A&#xD;O&apos;Shea, John&#xD;Melief, Cornelis J M&#xD;England&#xD;J Transl Med. 2012 Mar 15;10:48.</notes><work-type>Congresses</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22420641</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3362772</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1479-5876-10-48</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1110</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1110</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stone, R.

METHODS: We analyzed clinical data on 619 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer to test associations between platelet counts and disease outcome. Human samples and mouse models of epithelial ovarian cancer were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of paraneoplastic thrombocytosis. The effects of platelets on tumor growth and angiogenesis were ascertained. RESULTS: Thrombocytosis was significantly associated with advanced disease and shortened survival. Plasma levels of thrombopoietin and interleukin-6 were significantly elevated in patients who had thrombocytosis as compared with those who did not. In mouse models, increased hepatic thrombopoietin synthesis in response to tumor-derived interleukin-6 was an underlying mechanism of paraneoplastic thrombocytosis. Tumor-derived interleukin-6 and hepatic thrombopoietin were also linked to thrombocytosis in patients. Silencing thrombopoietin and interleukin-6 abrogated thrombocytosis in tumor-bearing mice. Anti-interleukin-6 antibody treatment significantly reduced platelet counts in tumor-bearing mice and in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. In addition, neutralizing interleukin-6 significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel in mouse models of epithelial ovarian cancer. The use of an antiplatelet antibody to halve platelet counts in tumor-bearing mice significantly reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the existence of a paracrine circuit wherein increased production of thrombopoietic cytokines in tumor and host tissue leads to paraneoplastic thrombocytosis, which fuels tumor growth. We speculate that countering paraneoplastic thrombocytosis either directly or indirectly by targeting these cytokines may have therapeutic potential.

Activated by various stresses, p53 blocks cancer progression by provoking transient or permanent growth arrest, by enabling DNA repair, or by advancing cellular death programs. This anti-cancer activity profile, together with genomic and mutational analyses documenting inactivation of p53 in more than 50% of human cancers, motivated drug development efforts to (re-) activate p53 in established tumors. AREAS COVERED: The complexities of p53 signaling in cancer are summarized, including current strategies and challenges to restore p53&apos;s tumor suppressive function in established tumors, to inactivate p53 inhibitors, and to restore wild type function of p53 mutant proteins. EXPERT OPINION: p53 represents an attractive target for the development of anti-cancer therapies. Whether p53 is &apos;druggable&apos;, however, remains an area of active research and discussion, as p53 has pro-survival functions and chronic p53 activation accelerates aging, which may compromise the long-term homeostasis of an organism. The complex biology and dual functions of p53 in cancer prevention and age-related cellular responses pose significant challenges to the development of p53-targeting cancer therapies.</abstract><notes>Stegh, Alexander H; R00CA129172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2012 Jan;16(1):67-83.

Among several promising strategies, liposomes represent an advanced technology to target active molecules to the site of action. Rapid clearance of circulating liposomal drugs administered intravenously has been a critical issue because circulation time in the blood affects drug exposure at the target site. The clinical use of liposomal drugs is complicated by large intra- and interindividual variability in their pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). Thus, it is important to understand the factors affecting the PK/PD of the liposomal formulation of drugs and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the variability in the PK/PD of liposomal drugs. In this review article, we describe the characteristics of liposome formulations and discuss the effects of various factors, including liposome-associated factors, host-associated factors, and treatment on the PK/PD of liposomal agents.</abstract><notes>Song, Gina&#xD;Wu, Huali&#xD;Yoshino, Keisuke&#xD;Zamboni, William C&#xD;1 U54 CA151652-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;J Liposome Res. 2012 Sep;22(3):177-92. doi: 10.3109/08982104.2012.655285.

Click chemistry, copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), is applied to generate a gas-phase cleavable linker suitable for the formation of reporter ions. Upon collisional activation, the 1,2,3-triazole ring constructed by CuAAC participates in a nucleophilic displacement reaction forming a six-membered ring and releasing a stable cationic reporter ion. To investigate its utility in peptide mass spectrometry, the energetics of the observed fragmentation pathway are examined by density functional theory. When this functional group is covalently attached to a target peptide, it is found that the nucleophilic displacement occurs in competition with formation of b- and y-type backbone fragment ions regardless of the amino acid side chains present in the parent bioconjugate, confirming that calculated reaction energetics of reporter ion formation are similar to those of backbone fragmentations. Based on these results, we apply this selective fragmentation pathway for the development of CIT reagents. For demonstration purposes, duplex CIT reagent is prepared using a single isotope-coded precursor, allyl-d(5)-bromide, with reporter ions appearing at m/z 164 and 169. Isotope-coded allyl azides for the construction of the reporter ion group can be prepared from halogenated alkyl groups which are also employed for the mass balance group via N-alkylation, reducing the cost and effort for synthesis of isobaric pairs. Owing to their modular designs, an unlimited number of isobaric combinations of CIT reagents are, in principle, possible. The reporter ion mass can be easily tuned to avoid overlapping with common peptide MS/MS fragments as well as the low mass cutoff problems inherent in ion trap mass spectrometers. The applicability of the CIT reagent is tested with several model systems involving protein mixtures and cellular systems.</abstract><notes>Sohn, Chang Ho&#xD;Lee, J Eugene&#xD;Sweredoski, Michael J&#xD;Graham, Robert L J&#xD;Smith, Geoffrey T&#xD;Hess, Sonja&#xD;Czerwieniec, Gregg&#xD;Loo, Joseph A&#xD;Deshaies, Raymond J&#xD;Beauchamp, J L&#xD;CA138126/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 GM103479/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;RR 20004/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151819-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;J Am Chem Soc. 2012 Feb 8;134(5):2672-80.

CXLs afford consolidated advantages not previously available in a simple cross-linker, including (1) their small size and cationic nature at physiological pH, resulting in good water solubility and cell-permeability, (2) an alkyne group for bio-orthogonal conjugation to affinity tags via the click reaction for enrichment of cross-linked peptides, (3) a nucleophilic displacement reaction involving the 1,2,3-triazole ring formed in the click reaction, yielding a lock-mass reporter ion for only clicked peptides, and (4) higher charge states of cross-linked peptides in the gas-phase for augmented electron transfer dissociation (ETD) yields. Ubiquitin, a lysine-abundant protein, is used as a model system to demonstrate structural studies using CXLs. To validate the sensitivity of our approach, biotin-azide labeling and subsequent enrichment of cross-linked peptides are performed for cross-linked ubiquitin digests mixed with yeast cell lysates. Cross-linked peptides are detected and identified by collision induced dissociation (CID) and ETD with linear quadrupole ion trap (LTQ)-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) and LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometers. The application of CXLs to more complex systems (e.g., in vivo cross-linking) is illustrated by Western blot detection of Cul1 complexes including known binders, Cand1 and Skp2, in HEK 293 cells, confirming good water solubility and cell-permeability.</abstract><notes>Sohn, Chang Ho&#xD;Agnew, Heather D&#xD;Lee, J Eugene&#xD;Sweredoski, Michael J&#xD;Graham, Robert L J&#xD;Smith, Geoffrey T&#xD;Hess, Sonja&#xD;Czerwieniec, Gregg&#xD;Loo, Joseph A&#xD;Heath, James R&#xD;Deshaies, Raymond J&#xD;Beauchamp, J L&#xD;CA138126/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 GM103479/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 GM103479-09/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;RR 20004/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151819-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Anal Chem. 2012 Mar 20;84(6):2662-9.

For most oncological applications, nanoparticles must extravasate in order to reach tumor cells and perform their designated task. However, little understanding exists regarding the effect of nanoparticle shape on extravasation. Herein we use real-time intravital microscopic imaging to meticulously examine how two different nanoparticles behave across three different murine tumor models. The study quantitatively demonstrates that high-aspect ratio single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) display extravasational behavior surprisingly different from, and counterintuitive to, spherical nanoparticles although the nanoparticles have similar surface coatings, area, and charge. This work quantitatively indicates that nanoscale extravasational competence is highly dependent on nanoparticle geometry and is heterogeneous.</abstract><notes>Smith, Bryan Ronain&#xD;Kempen, Paul&#xD;Bouley, Donna&#xD;Xu, Alexander&#xD;Liu, Zhuang&#xD;Melosh, Nicholas&#xD;Dai, Hongjie&#xD;Sinclair, Robert&#xD;Gambhir, Sanjiv Sam&#xD;K99 CA160764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R25 CA118681/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Nano Lett. 2012 Jul 11;12(7):3369-77. doi: 10.1021/nl204175t.

A hallmark of the disease is a pronounced collagen-rich fibrotic extracellular matrix known as the desmoplastic reaction. Intriguingly, it is precisely these areas of fibrosis in which human PDAC tumours demonstrate increased expression of a key collagenase, MT1-MMP [membrane-type 1 MMP (matrix metalloproteinase); also known as MMP-14]. Furthermore, a cytokine known to mediate fibrosis in vivo, TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1), is up-regulated in human PDAC tumours and can promote MT1-MMP expression. In the present review, we examine the regulation of PDAC progression through the interplay between type I collagen (the most common extracellular matrix present in human PDAC tumours), MT1-MMP and TGF-beta1. Specifically, we examine the way in which signalling events through these pathways mediates invasion, regulates microRNAs and contributes to chemoresistance.</abstract><notes>Shields, Mario A; Dangi-Garimella, Surabhi; Redig, Amanda J; Munshi, Hidayatullah G; R01CA126888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Biochem J. 2012 Jan 15;441(2):541-52.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Review</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22187935</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1042/BJ20111240</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>614</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">614</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shi, Q.</author><author>Qin, L.</author><author>Wei, W.</author><author>Geng, F.</author><author>Fan, R.</author><author>Shin, Y.

We use the platform to assess protein-protein interactions associated with the EGF-receptor-mediated PI3K signaling pathway. Single-cell sensitivity is achieved by isolating a defined number of cells (n = 0-5) in 2 nL volume chambers, each of which is patterned with two copies of a miniature antibody array. The cells are lysed on-chip, and the levels of released proteins are assayed using the antibody arrays. We investigate three isogenic cell lines representing the cancer glioblastoma multiforme, at the basal level, under EGF stimulation, and under erlotinib inhibition plus EGF stimulation. The measured protein abundances are consistent with previous work, and single-cell analysis uniquely reveals single-cell heterogeneity, and different types and strengths of protein-protein interactions. This platform helps provide a comprehensive picture of altered signal transduction networks in tumor cells and provides insight into the effect of targeted therapies on protein signaling networks.</abstract><notes>Shi, Qihui; Qin, Lidong; Wei, Wei; Geng, Feng; Fan, Rong; Shin, Young Shik; Guo, Deliang; Hood, Leroy; Mischel, Paul S; Heath, James R; 5U54 CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Jan 10;109(2):419-24.

Although these hold promise as potential biomarkers of therapeutic response, their identification and quantification remain challenging. Here, we describe a highly sensitive and rapid analytical technique for profiling circulating microvesicles directly from blood samples of patients with glioblastoma. Microvesicles, introduced onto a dedicated microfluidic chip, are labeled with target-specific magnetic nanoparticles and detected by a miniaturized nuclear magnetic resonance system. Compared with current methods, this integrated system has a much higher detection sensitivity and can differentiate glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) microvesicles from nontumor host cell-derived microvesicles. We also show that circulating GBM microvesicles can be used to analyze primary tumor mutations and as a predictive metric of treatment-induced changes.

Recently, the geometrical confinement of Gd(3+) -based contrast agents (CAs) within porous structures has been proposed as a novel, alternative strategy to improve relaxivity without chemical modification of the CA. Here, we have characterized and optimized the performance of MRI nanoconstructs obtained by loading [Gd(DTPA)(H(2) O)](2-) (Magnevist(R)) into the pores of injectable mesoporous silicon particles. Nanoconstructs with three different pore sizes were studied, and at 60 MHz, they exhibited longitudinal relaxivities of ~24 m m(-1) s(-1) for 5-10 nm pores and ~10 m m(-1) s(-1) for 30 - 40 nm pores. No enhancement in relaxivity was observed for larger pores sizes. Using an outer-sphere compound, [GdTTHA](3-) , and mathematical modeling, it was demonstrated that the relaxivity enhancement is due to the increase in rotational correlation times (CA adsorbed on the pore walls) and diffusion correlation times (reduced mobility of the water molecules), as the pore sizes decreases. It was also observed that extensive CA adsorption on the outer surface of the silicon particles negates the advantages offered by nanoscale confinement. Upon incubation with HeLa cells, the nanoconstructs did not demonstrate significant cytotoxicity for up to 3 days post incubation, at different particle/cell ratios. In addition, the nanoconstructs showed complete degradation after 24 h of continuous agitation in phosphate-buffered saline. These data support and confirm the hypothesis that the geometrical confinement of Gd(3+) -chelate compounds into porous structures offers MRI nanoconstructs with enhanced relaxivity (up to 6 times for [Gd(DTPA)(H(2) O)](2-) , and 4 times for [GdTTHA](3-) ) and, potentially, improved stability, reduced toxicity and tissue specificity.</abstract><notes>Sethi, Richa&#xD;Ananta, Jeyarama S&#xD;Karmonik, Christof&#xD;Zhong, Meng&#xD;Fung, Steve H&#xD;Liu, Xuewu&#xD;Li, King&#xD;Ferrari, Mauro&#xD;Wilson, Lon J&#xD;Decuzzi, Paolo&#xD;U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Contrast Media Mol Imaging. 2012 Nov-Dec;7(6):501-8. doi: 10.1002/cmmi.1480.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22991316</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/cmmi.1480</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1228</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1228</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Seetharam, M.</author><author>Fan, A.

Here we develop nanoparticles that can be controllably triggered to synthesize proteins. The nanoparticles consist of lipid vesicles filled with the cellular machinery responsible for transcription and translation, including amino acids, ribosomes, and DNA caged with a photolabile protecting group. These particles served as nanofactories capable of producing proteins including green fluorescent protein (GFP) and enzymatically active luciferase. In vitro and in vivo, protein synthesis was spatially and temporally controllable, and could be initiated by irradiating micrometer-scale regions on the time scale of milliseconds.

Effective intracellular delivery requires the development of potent siRNA carriers. Here, we describe the synthesis and screening of a series of siRNA delivery materials. Short polyethyleneimine (PEI, Mw 600) was selected as a cationic backbone to which lipid tails were conjugated at various levels of saturation. In solution these polymer-lipid hybrids self-assemble to form nanoparticles capable of complexing siRNA. The complexes silence genes specifically and with low cytotoxicity. The efficiency of gene knockdown increased as the number of lipid tails conjugated to the PEI backbone increased. This is explained by reducing the binding affinity between the siRNA strands to the complex, thereby enabling siRNA release after cellular internalization.

This unique form of radiation is currently only produced in a few large synchrotron accelerator research facilities in the world. To promote widespread translational research on this promising treatment technology we have proposed and are in the initial development stages of a compact MRT system that is based on carbon nanotube field emission x-ray technology. We report on a Monte Carlo based feasibility study of the compact MRT system design. METHODS: Monte Carlo calculations were performed using EGSnrc-based codes. The proposed small animal research MRT device design includes carbon nanotube cathodes shaped to match the corresponding MRT collimator apertures, a common reflection anode with filter, and a MRT collimator. Each collimator aperture is sized to deliver a beam width ranging from 30 to 200 mum at 18.6 cm source-to-axis distance. Design parameters studied with Monte Carlo include electron energy, cathode design, anode angle, filtration, and collimator design. Calculations were performed for single and multibeam configurations. RESULTS: Increasing the energy from 100 kVp to 160 kVp increased the photon fluence through the collimator by a factor of 1.7. Both energies produced a largely uniform fluence along the long dimension of the microbeam, with 5% decreases in intensity near the edges. The isocentric dose rate for 160 kVp was calculated to be 700 GyminA in the center of a 3 cm diameter target. Scatter contributions resulting from collimator size were found to produce only small (&lt;7%) changes in the dose rate for field widths greater than 50 mum. Dose vs depth was weakly dependent on filtration material. The peak-to-valley ratio varied from 10 to 100 as the separation between adjacent microbeams varies from 150 to 1000 mum. CONCLUSIONS: Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed compact MRT system design is capable of delivering a sufficient dose rate and peak-to-valley ratio for small animal MRT studies.</abstract><notes>Schreiber, Eric C&#xD;Chang, Sha X&#xD;1U54CA151652-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;5RC2CA148487-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Med Phys. 2012 Aug;39(8):4669-78.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22894391</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3411585</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1118/1.4728220</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>525</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">525</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmeler, K.

Unlike other models that initiate tumors before the development of a mature immune system, we detect measurable anti-tumor immunity from very early stages, which is driven by infiltrating dendritic cells (DCs) and prevents steady tumor growth for prolonged periods. Coinciding with a phenotypic switch in expanding DC infiltrates, tumors aggressively progress to terminal disease in a comparatively short time. Notably, tumor cells remain immunogenic at advanced stages, but anti-tumor T cells become less responsive, whereas their enduring activity is abrogated by different microenvironmental immunosuppressive DCs. Correspondingly, depleting DCs early in the disease course accelerates tumor expansion, but DC depletion at advanced stages significantly delays aggressive malignant progression. Our results indicate that phenotypically divergent DCs drive both immunosurveillance and accelerated malignant growth. We provide experimental support for the cancer immunoediting hypothesis, but we also show that aggressive cancer progression after a comparatively long latency period is primarily driven by the mobilization of immunosuppressive microenvironmental leukocytes, rather than loss of tumor immunogenicity.</abstract><notes>Scarlett, Uciane K; Rutkowski, Melanie R; Rauwerdink, Adam M; Fields, Jennifer; Escovar-Fadul, Ximena; Baird, Jason; Cubillos-Ruiz, Juan R; Jacobs, Ana C; Gonzalez, Jorge L; Weaver, John; Fiering, Steven; Conejo-Garcia, Jose R; F31CA134188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P30CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA124515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA124515S/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA157664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21CA132026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Exp Med. 2012 Mar 12;209(3):495-506.

The optimized PEI-PE/pDNA complexes at an N/P ratio of 16 had a particle size of 225 nm, a surface charge of +31 mV, and protected the pDNA from the action of DNase I. The PEI-PE conjugate had a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of about 34 mug/ml and exhibited no toxicity compared to a high molecular weight PEI (PEI 25 kDa) as tested with B16-F10 melanoma cells. The B16-F10 cells transfected with PEI-PE/pEGFP complexes showed protein expression levels higher than with PEI-1.8 or PEI-25 vectors. Complexes prepared with YOYO 1-labeled pEGFP confirmed the enhanced delivery of the plasmid with PEI-PE compared to PEI-1.8 and PEI-25. The PEI-PE/pDNA complexes were also mixed with various amounts of micelle-forming material, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-PE to improve biocompatibility. The resulting particles exhibited a neutral surface charge, resistance to salt-induced aggregation, and good transfection activity in the presence of serum in complete media. The use of the low-pH-degradable PEG-hydrazone-PE produced particles with transfection activity sensitive to changes in pH consistent with the relatively acidic tumor environment.</abstract><notes>Sawant, Rupa R; Sriraman, Shravan Kumar; Navarro, Gemma; Biswas, Swati; Dalvi, Riddhi A; Torchilin, Vladimir P; 1U54CA151881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA121838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Biomaterials. 2012 May;33(15):3942-51.

Here, the in vivo delivery and binding kinetics of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was determined for normal pancreas and AsPC-1 orthotopic pancreatic tumors known to overexpress EGFR. PROCEDURES: EGFR in orthotopic xenograft AsPC-1 tumors was targeted with epidermal growth factor (EGF) conjugated with IRDye800CW. The transfer rate constants (k(e), K(1)(2), k(2)(1), k(2)(3), and k(3)(2)) associated with a three-compartment model describing the vascular delivery, leakage rate and binding of targeted agents were determined experimentally. The plasma excretion rate, k (e), was determined from extracted blood plasma samples. K(1)(2), k(2)(1), and k(3)(2) were determined from ex vivo tissue washing studies at time points &gt;/= 24 h. The measured in vivo uptake of IRDye800CW-EGF and a non-targeted tracer dye, IRDye700DX-carboxylate, injected simultaneously was used to determined k(2)(3). RESULTS: The vascular exchange of IRDye800CW-EGF in the orthotopic tumor (K(1)(2) and k(2)(1)) was higher than in the AsPC-1 tumor as compared to normal pancreas, suggesting that more targeted agent can be taken up in tumor tissue. However, the cellular associated (binding) rate constant (k(2)(3)) was slightly lower for AsPC-1 pancreatic tumor (4.1 x 10(-4) s(-1)) than the normal pancreas (5.5 x 10(-4) s(-1)), implying that less binding is occurring. CONCLUSIONS: Higher vascular delivery but low cellular association in the AsPC-1 tumor compared to the normal pancreas may be indicative of low receptor density due to low cellular content. This attribute of the AsPC-1 tumor may indicate one contributing cause of the difficulty in treating pancreatic tumors with cellular targeted agents.</abstract><notes>P01 CA084203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P01CA84201/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA156177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01CA156177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA105480/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Comparative Study&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;United States&#xD;MIB : the official publication of the Academy of Molecular Imaging</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=21847690 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1279</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1279</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sadeghi, S.</author><author>Ding, H.</author><author>Shah, G.

Adding only a single series resistor to existing AC droplet actuation circuits, the platform is simple to implement and has negligible effect on actuation voltage. To accurately measure the complex voltage across the resistor (and hence current through the device and droplet), the designed system is based on software-implemented lock-in amplification detection of the voltage drop across the resistor which filters out noise, enabling high-resolution and low-limit signal recovery. We observe picoliter sensitivity with linear correlation of voltage to volume extending to the microliter volumes that can be handled by digital microfluidic devices. Due to the minimal hardware, the system is robust and measurements are highly repeatable. The detection technique provides both phase and magnitude information of the real-time current flowing through the droplet for a full impedance measurement. The sensitivity and resolution of this platform enables it to distinguish between various liquids which, as demonstrated in this paper, could potentially be extended to quantify solute concentrations, liquid mixtures, and presence of analytes.</abstract><notes>Sadeghi, Saman&#xD;Ding, Huijiang&#xD;Shah, Gaurav J&#xD;Chen, Supin&#xD;Keng, Pei Yuin&#xD;Kim, Chang-Jin&#xD;van Dam, R Michael&#xD;Anal Chem. 2012 Feb 21;84(4):1915-23.

Since then, it has become apparent that both the tumor and the anti-cancer immune response evolve over a long period to allow the eventual escape of nascent precancerous lesions into full-blown tumors. Although primarily focusing on loss of antigenicity, the immunoediting hypothesis has gradually evolved to appreciate the role of active immunosuppression in tumor progression, where myeloid leukocytes are increasingly recognized as the major driving force. This review highlights recent studies implicating how myeloid cells with antigen-presenting capabilities are co-opted by tumors to promote malignant progression. Because at least some advanced tumors remain significantly immunogenic, these new studies add a tweak to the immunoediting hypothesis as well as a rationale to block immunosuppressive mechanisms as a first-line intervention in cancer patients.</abstract><notes>Rutkowski, Melanie R&#xD;Stephen, Tom L&#xD;Conejo-Garcia, Jose R&#xD;R01 CA124515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA157664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Cell Immunol. 2012 Jul;278(1-2):21-6. doi: 10.1016/j.cellimm.2012.06.014.

METHODS: We reviewed the effect of diabetes and diabetes medications on ovarian cancer treatment and outcomes in a single-institution retrospective cohort. Inclusion criteria were International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I-IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal cancer. Exclusion criteria were noninvasive pathology or nonepithelial malignancies. The primary exposures analyzed were history of type II diabetes and diabetes medications. The primary outcomes were progression-free and overall ovarian cancer survival. RESULTS: Of the 341 ovarian cancer patients included in the study, 297 did not have diabetes, 28 were type II diabetic patients who did not use metformin, and 16 were type II diabetic patients who used metformin. The progression-free survival at 5 years was 51% for diabetic patients who used metformin compared with 23% for the nondiabetic patients and 8% for the diabetic patients who did not use metformin (P=.03). The overall survival at 5 years was 63%, 37%, and 23% for the diabetic patients who used metformin, the nondiabetic patients, and the diabetic patients who did not use metformin, respectively (P=.03). The patients with diabetes received the same treatment for ovarian cancer as the patients without diabetes. The association of metformin use and increased progression-free survival, but not overall survival, remained significant after controlling for standard clinicopathologic parameters.

SIOS is able to characterize smaller particles than other direct count techniques such as flow cytometry or Coulter counters, and the direct count avoids approximations such as those necessary for turbidity measurements. Measurements in a model system of 210-710 nm diameter polystyrene particles demonstrate that the event frequency scales linearly with applied pressure and concentration, and that measured concentrations are independent of particle type and size. Both an external-calibration and a calibration-free measurement method are demonstrated. SIOS is then applied to measure concentrations of Baculovirus occlusion bodies, with a diameter of ~1 mum, and the marine photosynthetic cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, with a diameter of ~600 nm. The determined concentrations agree well with results from counting with microscopy (a 17% difference between the mean concentrations) and flow cytometry (6% difference between the mean concentrations), respectively.</abstract><notes>Roberts, G Seth; Yu, Sam; Zeng, Qinglu; Chan, Leslie C L; Anderson, Will; Colby, Aaron H; Grinstaff, Mark W; Reid, Steven; Vogel, Robert; England; Biosens Bioelectron. 2012 Jan 15;31(1):17-25.

Unfortunately, the number and complexity of identified alterations complicate endeavors to identify biologically relevant mutations critical for tumor maintenance because many of these targets are not amenable to manipulation by small molecules or antibodies. RNA interference provides a direct way to study putative cancer targets; however, specific delivery of therapeutics to the tumor parenchyma remains an intractable problem. We describe a platform for the discovery and initial validation of cancer targets, composed of a systematic effort to identify amplified and essential genes in human cancer cell lines and tumors partnered with a novel modular delivery technology. We developed a tumor-penetrating nanocomplex (TPN) that comprised small interfering RNA (siRNA) complexed with a tandem tumor-penetrating and membrane-translocating peptide, which enabled the specific delivery of siRNA deep into the tumor parenchyma. We used TPN in vivo to evaluate inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (ID4) as a novel oncogene. Treatment of ovarian tumor-bearing mice with ID4-specific TPN suppressed growth of established tumors and significantly improved survival. These observations not only credential ID4 as an oncogene in 32% of high-grade ovarian cancers but also provide a framework for the identification, validation, and understanding of potential therapeutic cancer targets.</abstract><notes>Ren, Yin&#xD;Cheung, Hiu Wing&#xD;von Maltzhan, Geoffrey&#xD;Agrawal, Amit&#xD;Cowley, Glenn S&#xD;Weir, Barbara A&#xD;Boehm, Jesse S&#xD;Tamayo, Pablo&#xD;Karst, Alison M&#xD;Liu, Joyce F&#xD;Hirsch, Michelle S&#xD;Mesirov, Jill P&#xD;Drapkin, Ronny&#xD;Root, David E&#xD;Lo, Justin&#xD;Fogal, Valentina&#xD;Ruoslahti, Erkki&#xD;Hahn, William C&#xD;Bhatia, Sangeeta N&#xD;P30 CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA105009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA124427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA152327/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R33 CA128625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;RC2 CA148268/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U01 CA152990/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA112962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada&#xD;Howard Hughes Medical Institute/&#xD;Sci Transl Med. 2012 Aug 15;4(147):147ra112. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3003778.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22896676</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/scitranslmed.3003778</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1330</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1330</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reif, R.</author><author>Haque, F.</author><author>Guo, P.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Nanobiotechnology Center, Markey Cancer Center and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Kentucky , Lexington, Kentucky.</auth-address><titles><title>Fluorogenic RNA nanoparticles for monitoring RNA folding and degradation in real time in living cells</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acid Ther</secondary-title><alt-title>Nucleic acid therapeutics</alt-title></titles><pages>428-37</pages><volume>22</volume><number>6</number><edition>2012/11/02</edition><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>Dec</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2159-3345 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>23113765</accession-num><abstract>Due to the discovery of more and more roles of cellular noncoding RNAs, the approaches for introducing RNAs including small interfering RNA (siRNA), micro RNA (miRNA), ribozyme, and riboswitch into cells for regulating cell life cycle and for the treatment of diseases have become routine practice. The understanding of RNA folding, degradation, and intracellular half-life after entering the cell is an intriguing question in biology and pharmacology. Currently, methods to detect RNA folding, degradation, and half-life in real time within the cell is extremely challenging. The common assay method to measure RNA half-life and degradation in vivo is the use of radioactive markers or fluorescence RNA labeling. The challenge is, after RNA becomes degraded or misfolded, the isotope or the fluorescence is still present in the cell, thus the signals are not a true indication of the presence of the RNA in the cell. The alternate method commonly used to measure RNA life is to isolate RNA from cells and distinguish between intact and degraded RNA by gel, chromatography, or capillary electrophoresis. However, when a cell is breaking down, ribonucleases (RNases) will be released from cell compartments, and degradation of small RNA in cell lysates occurs immediately after cell lysis. Here we report a method to monitor RNA degradation in real time in living cells using fluorogenic RNA in combination with RNA nanotechnology (Guo, 2010 ; Guo et al., 2012 ). The RNA aptamer that binds malachite green (MG), the ribozyme that cleaves the hepatitis virus genome, and a siRNA for firefly luciferase were all fused to the bacteriophage phi29 packaging RNA (pRNA) 3-way junction (3WJ) motif to generate RNA nanoparticles. The MG aptamer, the hepatitis B virus ribozyme, and the luciferase siRNA all retained their function independently after fusion into the nanoparticles. When the RNA nanoparticle is degraded, denatured, or misfolded, the fluorescence disappears. MG, which is not fluorescent by itself, is capable of binding to its aptamer and emitting fluorescent light only if the RNA remains folded in the correct conformation. Therefore, the MG aptamer fluorescence (in the presence of MG dye) can be used as a measure of the degradation and folding of RNA nanoparticles, the siRNA, the aptamer, and the ribozyme in the cell in real time using epifluorescence microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy without lysing the cells. We show that the half-life (t(1/2)) of the electroporated MG aptamer containing RNA nanoparticle was 4.3 hours after electroporation into cells.</abstract><notes>Reif, Randall&#xD;Haque, Farzin&#xD;Guo, Peixuan&#xD;Nucleic Acid Ther. 2012 Dec;22(6):428-37. doi: 10.1089/nat.2012.0380.

An enhanced understanding of the dynamics of magnetic particles may lead to advances in imaging directly in magnetic particle imaging or through enhanced MRI contrast and is essential for nanoparticle sensing as in magnetic spectroscopy of Brownian motion. Moreover, therapeutic techniques like hyperthermia require information about particle dynamics for effective, safe, and reliable use in the clinic. To that end, we have developed and validated a stochastic dynamical model of rotating Brownian nanoparticles from a Langevin equation approach. With no field, the relaxation time toward equilibrium matches Einstein&apos;s model of Brownian motion. In a static field, the equilibrium magnetization agrees with the Langevin function. For high frequency or low amplitude driving fields, behavior characteristic of the linearized Debye approximation is reproduced. In a higher field regime where magnetic saturation occurs, the magnetization and its harmonics compare well with the effective field model. On another level, the model has been benchmarked against experimental results, successfully demonstrating that harmonics of the magnetization carry enough information to infer environmental parameters like viscosity and temperature.</abstract><notes>P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal article</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23319830 </url></related-urls></urls><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1140</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1140</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rane, T.

The robotic sample-handling techniques currently used in these industries, although fast, are still limited to operating in multiwell plates with the sample volumes per reaction in the microliter regime. Digital microfluidics offers an alternative for reduction in sample volume consumption for HTS but lacks a reliable technique for transporting a large number of samples to the microfluidic device. In this report, we develop a technique for serial delivery of sample arrays to a microfluidic device from multiwell plates, through a single sample inlet. Under this approach, a serial array of sample plugs, separated by an immiscible carrier fluid, is loaded into a capillary and delivered to a microfluidic device. Similar approaches have been attempted in the past, however, either with a slower sample loading device such as a syringe pump or vacuum-based sample loading with limited driving pressure. We demonstrated the application of our positive-pressure-based serial sample loading (SSL) system to load a series of sample plugs into a capillary. The adaptability of the SSL system to generate sample plugs with a variety of volumes in a predictable manner was also demonstrated.</abstract><notes>Rane, Tushar D&#xD;Zec, Helena C&#xD;Wang, Tza-Huei&#xD;R01CA155305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;J Lab Autom. 2012 Oct;17(5):370-7.

The small sizes, unique chemical properties, large surface areas, structural diversity and multifunctionality of nanoparticles prove to be greatly advantageous for combating notoriously therapeutically evasive diseases such as cancer. Multifunctional nanoparticles have been designed to enhance tumor uptake through either passive or active targeting, while also avoiding reticuloendothelial system uptake through the incorporation of PEG onto the surface. First-generation nanoparticle systems, such as liposomes, are good carriers for drugs and nucleic acid therapeutics, although they have some limitations. These lipid bilayers are now being utilized as excellent carriers for drug-loaded, solid core particles such as iron oxide, mesoporus silica and calcium phosphate.

In this study, we investigated the systemic delivery of a siRNA nanoparticle targeting ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2), and evaluated its intratumoral kinetics, efficacy and mechanism of action. Knockdown of RRM2 by an RNAi mechanism strongly inhibited cell growth in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. In a mouse xenograft model of HNSCC, a single intravenous injection led to the accumulation of intact nanoparticles in the tumor that disassembled over a period of at least 3days, leading to target gene knockdown lasting at least 10days.

The latter can be caused by localized acidity, a phenomenon that can occur as a result of the combined actions of bacterial metabolism and the host immune response. Nanoparticles (NP) have shown promise in treating bacterial infections, but a significant challenge has been to develop antibacterial NPs that may be suitable for systemic administration. Herein we develop drug-encapsulated, pH-responsive, surface charge-switching poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-poly(L-histidine)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-PLH-PEG) nanoparticles for treating bacterial infections. These NP drug carriers are designed to shield nontarget interactions at pH 7.4 but bind avidly to bacteria in acidity, delivering drugs and mitigating in part the loss of drug activity with declining pH. The mechanism involves pH-sensitive NP surface charge switching, which is achieved by selective protonation of the imidazole groups of PLH at low pH. NP binding studies demonstrate pH-sensitive NP binding to bacteria with a 3.5 +/- 0.2- to 5.8 +/- 0.1-fold increase in binding to bacteria at pH 6.0 compared to 7.4. Further, PLGA-PLH-PEG-encapsulated vancomycin demonstrates reduced loss of efficacy at low pH, with an increase in minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.3-fold as compared to 2.0-fold and 2.3-fold for free and PLGA-PEG-encapsulated vancomycin, respectively. The PLGA-PLH-PEG NPs described herein are a first step toward developing systemically administered drug carriers that can target and potentially treat Gram-positive, Gram-negative, or polymicrobial infections associated with acidity.</abstract><notes>Radovic-Moreno, Aleksandar F; Lu, Timothy K; Puscasu, Vlad A; Yoon, Christopher J; Langer, Robert; Farokhzad, Omid C; CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; DP2OD008435/OD/NIH HHS/; EB003647/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2012 May 22;6(5):4279-87.

We tested the effect of SOM230 on insulin secretion, serum glucose concentrations, tumor growth, and survival using an MEN1 transgenic mouse model. METHODS: Eight 12-month-old conditional Men1 knockout mice with insulinoma were assessed. The treatment (n = 4) and control groups (n = 4) received monthly subcutaneous injections of SOM230 or PBS. Serum insulin and glucose levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and enzymatic colorimetric assay, respectively. Tumor activity, growth, and apoptosis were determined by microPET/CT scan and histologic analysis. RESULTS: On day 7, there was a decrease in serum insulin levels from 1.06 +/- 0.28 mug/L to 0.37 +/- 0.17 mug/L (P = .0128) and a significant increase in serum glucose from 4.2 +/- 0.45 mmol/L to 7.12 +/- 1.06 mmol/L (P = .0075) in the treatment group but no change in the control group. Tumor size was less in the treatment group (2,098 +/- 388 mum(2)) compared with the control group (7,067 +/- 955 mum(2); P = .0024). Furthermore, apoptosis was increased in the treatment group (6.9 +/- 1.23%) compared with the control group (0.29 +/- 0.103%; P = .002). CONCLUSION: SOM230 demonstrates antisecretory, antiproliferative, and proapoptotic activity in our MEN1 model of insulinoma. Further studies of the effects of SOM230 in PNET patients with MEN1 mutations are warranted.</abstract><notes>R01 CA103830/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23102680 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>688</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">688</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qin, S.</author><author>Zhou, Y.</author><author>Lok, A.

A combination of protein C and retinol-binding protein 4 in serum gave promising preliminary results as candidate biomarkers to distinguish patients at different stages of hepatic fibrosis due to chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV).

The stationary digital breast tomosynthesis (s-DBT) design aims to (i) increase the system spatial resolution by eliminating image blurring due to x-ray tube motion and (ii) reduce the scanning time. Low spatial resolution and long scanning time are the two main technical limitations of current DBT technology. METHODS: A CNT x-ray source array was designed and evaluated against a set of targeted system performance parameters. Simulations were performed to determine the maximum anode heat load at the desired focal spot size and to design the electron focusing optics. Field emission current from CNT cathode was measured for an extended period of time to determine the stable life time of CNT cathode for an expected clinical operation scenario. The source array was manufactured, tested, and integrated with a Selenia scanner. An electronic control unit was developed to interface the source array with the detection system and to scan and regulate x-ray beams. The performance of the s-DBT system was evaluated using physical phantoms. RESULTS: The spatially distributed CNT x-ray source array comprised 31 individually addressable x-ray sources covering a 30 angular span with 1 pitch and an isotropic focal spot size of 0.6 mm at full width at half-maximum. Stable operation at 28 kV(peak) anode voltage and 38 mA tube current was demonstrated with extended lifetime and good source-to-source consistency. For the standard imaging protocol of 15 views over 14, 100 mAs dose, and 2 x 2 detector binning, the projection resolution along the scanning direction increased from 4.0 cycles/mm [at 10% modulation-transfer-function (MTF)] in DBT to 5.1 cycles/mm in s-DBT at magnification factor of 1.08. The improvement is more pronounced for faster scanning speeds, wider angular coverage, and smaller detector pixel sizes. The scanning speed depends on the detector, the number of views, and the imaging dose. With 240 ms detector readout time, the s-DBT system scanning time is 6.3 s for a 15-view, 100 mAs scan regardless of the angular coverage. The scanning speed can be reduced to less than 4 s when detectors become faster. Initial phantom studies showed good quality reconstructed images. CONCLUSIONS: A prototype s-DBT scanner has been developed and evaluated by retrofitting the Selenia rotating gantry DBT scanner with a spatially distributed CNT x-ray source array. Preliminary results show that it improves system spatial resolution substantially by eliminating image blur due to x-ray focal spot motion. The scanner speed of s-DBT system is independent of angular coverage and can be increased with faster detector without image degration. The accelerated lifetime measurement demonstrated the long term stability of CNT x-ray source array with typical clinical operation lifetime over 3 years.</abstract><notes>Qian, Xin&#xD;Tucker, Andrew&#xD;Gidcumb, Emily&#xD;Shan, Jing&#xD;Yang, Guang&#xD;Calderon-Colon, Xiomara&#xD;Sultana, Shabana&#xD;Lu, Jianping&#xD;Zhou, Otto&#xD;Spronk, Derrek&#xD;Sprenger, Frank&#xD;Zhang, Yiheng&#xD;Kennedy, Don&#xD;Farbizio, Tom&#xD;Jing, Zhenxue&#xD;R01CA134598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Med Phys. 2012 Apr;39(4):2090-9.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22482630</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3321055</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1118/1.3694667</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1223</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1223</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qian, X.</author><author>Tucker, A.</author><author>Gidcumb, E.</author><author>Lu, J.</author><author>Zhou, O.</author><author>Spronk, D.</author><author>Sprenger, F.</author><author>Zhang, Y.</author><author>Kennedy, D.</author><author>Farbizio, T.</author><author>Jing, Z.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A stationary digital breast tomosynthesis scanner</title><secondary-title>SPIE Medical Imaging</secondary-title></titles><pages>831352-831352</pages><dates><year>2012</year></dates><abstract>A prototype stationary digital breast tomosynthesis (s-DBT) system has been developed by retrofitting a Hologic Selenia Dimension rotating gantry tomosynthesis scanner with a spatially distributed carbon nanotube (CNT) x-ray source array.

The CNT x-ray source array comprises 31 individually addressable x-ray beams covering 30&amp;amp;deg; angular span. Each x-ray beam has a minimum focal spot size of 0.64&amp;amp;times;0.61mm (full-width-at-half-maximum), a stationary W anode operating up to 50kVp, and 1mm thick Al filter. The flux from each beam is regulated and varied using dedicated control electronics. The maximum tube current is determined by the heat load of the stationary anode and depends on the energy, pulse width and the focal spot size used. Stable operation at 28kVp, 27mA tube current, 250msec pulse width and 38mA tube current, 183msec pulse width per exposure was achieved with extended lifetime. The standard ACR phantom was imaged and analyzed to evaluate the image quality. The actual scanning speed depends on the number of views and the readout time of the x-ray detector. With the present detector, 6 second scanning time at either 15 views or 31 views can be achieved at 100mAs total imaging dose with a detector readout time of 240msec.</abstract><notes>10.1117/12.911540</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.911540</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.911540</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>343</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">343</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prigodich, A.

For example, the efficacy of the common anticancer agent doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in cancer cells. While dose escalation of DOX can circumvent such resistance to a degree, this is precluded by the appearance of cardiotoxicity, a particularly debilitating condition in children. In vitro studies have established the ability of the natural phytochemical curcumin to overcome MDR; however, its widespread clinical application is restricted by poor solubility and low bioavailability. Building upon our recently developed polymer nanoparticle of curcumin (NanoCurc or NC) that significantly enhances the systemic bioavailability of curcumin, we synthesized a doxorubicin-curcumin composite nanoparticle formulation called NanoDoxCurc (NDC) for overcoming DOX resistance. Compared to DOX alone, NDC inhibited the MDR phenotype and caused striking growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo in several models of DOX-resistant cancers (multiple myeloma, acute leukemia, prostate and ovarian cancers, respectively). Notably, NDC-treated mice also demonstrated complete absence of cardiac toxicity, as assessed by echocardiography, or any bone marrow suppression, even at cumulative dosages where free DOX and pegylated liposomal DOX (Doxil(R)) resulted in demonstrable attenuation of cardiac function and hematological toxicities. This improvement in safety profile was achieved through a reduction of DOX-induced intracellular oxidative stress, as indicated by total glutathione levels and glutathione peroxidase activity in cardiac tissue. A composite DOX-curcumin nanoparticle that overcomes both MDR-based DOX chemoresistance and DOX-induced cardiotoxicity holds promise for providing lasting and safe anticancer therapy.</abstract><notes>Pramanik, Dipankar&#xD;Campbell, Nathaniel R&#xD;Das, Samarjit&#xD;Gupta, Sonal&#xD;Chenna, Venugopal&#xD;Bisht, Savita&#xD;Sysa-Shah, Polina&#xD;Bedja, Djahida&#xD;Karikari, Collins&#xD;Steenbergen, Charles&#xD;Gabrielson, Kathleen L&#xD;Maitra, Amarnath&#xD;Maitra, Anirban&#xD;U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Oncotarget. 2012 Jun;3(6):640-50.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22791660</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3442295</custom2><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1322</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1322</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Poruk, K.

However, most patients presenting with distant metastases, are not resectable, and have a 5-year survival rate of close to 0%. This demonstrates a need for improved screening to identify pancreatic cancer while the tumor is still localized and amenable to surgical resection. Studies of patients with pancreatic tumors incidentally diagnosed demonstrate longer median survival than tumors discovered only when the patient is symptomatic, suggesting that early detection may improve outcome. Recent evidence from genomic sequencing indicates a 15-year interval for genetic progression of pancreatic cancer from initiation to the metastatic stage, suggesting a sufficient window for early detection. Still, many challenges remain in implementing effective screening. Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer relies on developing screening methodologies with highly sensitive and specific biomarkers and imaging modalities. It also depends on a better understanding of the risk factors and natural history of the disease to accurately identify high-risk groups that would be best served by screening. This review summarizes our current understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer relevant to methods available for screening. At this time, given the lack of proven benefit in this disease, screening efforts should probably be undertaken in the context of prospective trials.</abstract><notes>Poruk, Katherine E&#xD;Firpo, Matthew A&#xD;Adler, Douglas G&#xD;Mulvihill, Sean J&#xD;Ann Surg. 2012 Aug 14.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22895395</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/SLA.0b013e31825ffbfb</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1166</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1166</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pohaku Mitchell, K.

To obviate this problem, silica nanoshells were tested for enhanced biodegradability by doping iron(III) into the nanoshells. Exposure of the doped silica to small molecule chelators and mammalian serum was explored to test whether the removal of iron(III) from the silica nanoshell structure would facilitate its degradation. Iron chelators, such as EDTA, desferrioxamine, and deferiprone, were found to cause the nanoshells to degrade on the removal of iron(III) within several days at 80 degrees C. When the iron(III)-doped, silica nanoshells were submerged in fetal bovine and human serums at physiological temperature, they also degrade via removal of the iron by serum proteins, such as transferrin, over a period of several weeks.</abstract><notes>Pohaku Mitchell, Kristina K&#xD;Liberman, Alexander&#xD;Kummel, Andrew C&#xD;Trogler, William C&#xD;P42ES010337/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01CA095298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R25 CA153915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA 119335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;J Am Chem Soc. 2012 Aug 29;134(34):13997-4003. doi: 10.1021/ja3036114.

Recent developments in nanomaterial-based detection platforms provide advantages over traditional approaches in terms of signal sensitivity, stability, and the possibility for performing multiplexed measurements. Here, we describe a bioorthogonal, nanoparticle amplification technique capable of rapid augmentation of detection sensitivities by up to 1-2 orders of magnitude over current methods. This improvement in sensitivity was achieved by (i) significantly reducing background noise arising from nonspecific nanoparticle binding, (ii) increasing nanomaterial binding through orthogonal rounds of amplification, and (iii) implementing a cleavage step to improve assay robustness. The developed method allowed sensitive detection and molecular profiling of scant tumor cells directly in unpurified human clinical samples such as ascites. With its high sensitivity and simplified assay steps, this technique will likely have broad utility in nanomaterial-based diagnostics.</abstract><notes>Peterson, Vanessa M&#xD;Castro, Cesar M&#xD;Lee, Hakho&#xD;Weissleder, Ralph&#xD;2-P50-CA86355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;2R01EB004626/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;HHSN268201000044C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;HHSN268201000044C/PHS HHS/&#xD;K12 CA087723-09S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;K12CA087723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA086355-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB004626-07/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB010011-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01EB010011/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151884-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;ACS Nano. 2012 Apr 24;6(4):3506-13.

The objective of this study was to determine whether multifocal disease on initial presentation is associated with worse survival. Methods The authors retrospectively reviewed records of 368 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and identified 47 patients with multifocal tumors. Each patient with a multifocal tumor was then matched with a patient with a solitary glioblastoma on the basis of age, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score, and extent of resection, using a propensity score matching methodology. Radiation and temozolomide treatments were also well matched between the 2 cohorts. Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests were used to compare patient survival. Results The incidence of multifocal tumors was 12.8% (47/368). The median age of patients with multifocal tumors was 61 years, 76.6% had KPS scores &gt;/= 70, and 87.2% underwent either a biopsy or partial resection of their tumors. The 47 patients with multifocal tumors were almost perfectly matched on the basis of age (p = 0.97), extent of resection (p = 1.0), and KPS score (p = 0.80) compared with 47 patients with a solitary glioblastoma. Age (&gt;65 years), partial resection or biopsy, and low KPS score (&lt;70) were associated with worse median survival within the multifocal group. In the multifocal group, 19 patients experienced tumor progression on postradiation therapy MRI, compared with 11 patients (26.8%) with tumor progression in the unifocal group (p = 0.08). Patients with multifocal tumors experienced a significantly shorter median overall survival of 6 months (95% CI 4-10 months), compared with the 11-month median survival (95% CI 10-19 months) of the matched solitary glioblastoma group (p = 0.02, log-rank test). Two-year survival rates were 4.3% for patients with multifocal tumors and 29.0% for the unifocal cohort. Patients with newly diagnosed multifocal tumors were found to have an almost 2-fold increase in the hazard of death compared with patients with solitary glioblastoma (hazard ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.1; p = 0.02). Tumor samples were analyzed for expression of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatase and tensin homolog, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, laminin beta1 and beta2, as well as epidermal growth factor receptor amplification, and no significant differences in expression profile between the multifocal and solitary glioblastoma groups was found. Conclusions Patients with newly diagnosed multifocal glioblastoma on presentation experience significantly worse survival than patients with solitary glioblastoma. Patients with multifocal tumors continue to pose a therapeutic challenge in the temozolomide era and magnify the challenges faced while treating patients with malignant gliomas.</abstract><notes>Patil, Chirag G&#xD;Yi, Anthony&#xD;Elramsisy, Adam&#xD;Hu, Jethro&#xD;Mukherjee, Debraj&#xD;Irvin, Dwain K&#xD;Yu, John S&#xD;Bannykh, Serguei I&#xD;Black, Keith L&#xD;Nuno, Miriam&#xD;J Neurosurg. 2012 Oct;117(4):705-11. doi: 10.3171/2012.7.JNS12147.

Furthermore, changing the steric bulk of the alkyl substituents on the silicon atom could regulate the rate of drug release and, therefore, the intracellular toxicity of the gemcitabine-loaded particles.

To uncover new transcription factors that would determine clinical outcomes in breast cancer, we systematically analyzed gene expression data from breast cancer patients. Our results revealed that Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) is the top-ranked survival-associated transcription factor in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Surprisingly, silencing FOXM1 expression led breast cancer cells to become more sensitive to doxorubicin (Dox). We found that FOXM1-dependent resistance to Dox is mediated by regulating DNA repair genes. We further demonstrated that NFkappaB1 interacts with FOXM1 in the presence of Dox to protect breast cancer cells from DNA damage. Finally, silencing FOXM1 expression in breast cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model significantly sensitized the cells to Dox. Our systematic approaches identified an unexpected role of FOXM1 in Dox resistance by regulating DNA repair genes, and our findings provide mechanistic insights into how FOXM1 mediates resistance to Dox and evidence that FOXM1 may be a promising therapeutic target for sensitizing breast cancer cells to Dox.</abstract><notes>CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;England</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=22581827 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>694</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">694</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Navarro, G.</author><author>Sawant, R.

The use of siRNA to inhibit P-gp expression in MDR tumors is an attractive strategy to improve the effectiveness of anticancer drugs. METHOD: We have synthesized a novel conjugate between a phospholipid (dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine) and polyethylenimine (PEI) for siRNA delivery, for the purpose of silencing P-gp to overcome doxorubicin resistance in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. RESULTS: The dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine-PEI conjugate enhanced the transfection efficacy of low-molecular-weight PEI, which was otherwise totally ineffective. In addition, the polyethylene glycol/lipid coating of the new complexes gave rise to small micelle-like nanoparticles with improved biocompatibility properties. Both coated and noncoated formulations delivered P-gp-specific siRNA to MDR cells. DISCUSSION: The combination of doxorubicin and P-gp silencing formulations led to a twofold increase of doxorubicin uptake and a significant improvement of the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin in resistant cells.</abstract><notes>Navarro, Gemma; Sawant, Rupa R; Biswas, Swati; Essex, Sean; Tros de Ilarduya, Conchita; Torchilin, Vladimir P; R01CA121838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; London, England; Nanomedicine (Lond). 2012 Jan;7(1):65-78.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22191778</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.2217/nnm.11.93</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1138</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1138</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nance, E.

This size range is large enough to allow diffusion of signaling molecules, nutrients, and metabolic waste products, but too small to allow efficient penetration of most particulate drug delivery systems and viruses carrying therapeutic genes, thereby limiting effectiveness of many potential therapies. We analyzed the movements of nanoparticles of various diameters and surface coatings within fresh human and rat brain tissue ex vivo and mouse brain in vivo. Nanoparticles as large as 114 nm in diameter diffused within the human and rat brain, but only if they were densely coated with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Using these minimally adhesive PEG-coated particles, we estimated that human brain tissue ECS has some pores larger than 200 nm and that more than one-quarter of all pores are &gt;/= 100 nm. These findings were confirmed in vivo in mice, where 40- and 100-nm, but not 200-nm, nanoparticles spread rapidly within brain tissue, only if densely coated with PEG. Similar results were observed in rat brain tissue with paclitaxel-loaded biodegradable nanoparticles of similar size (85 nm) and surface properties. The ability to achieve brain penetration with larger nanoparticles is expected to allow more uniform, longer-lasting, and effective delivery of drugs within the brain, and may find use in the treatment of brain tumors, stroke, neuroinflammation, and other brain diseases where the blood-brain barrier is compromised or where local delivery strategies are feasible.</abstract><notes>Nance, Elizabeth A&#xD;Woodworth, Graeme F&#xD;Sailor, Kurt A&#xD;Shih, Ting-Yu&#xD;Xu, Qingguo&#xD;Swaminathan, Ganesh&#xD;Xiang, Dennis&#xD;Eberhart, Charles&#xD;Hanes, Justin&#xD;5T32CA130840-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01CA164789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Sci Transl Med. 2012 Aug 29;4(149):149ra119. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3003594.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22932224</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/scitranslmed.3003594</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1336</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1336</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morshed, A.

We show here that germline deletion of Ada3 in mouse is embryonic lethal, and adenovirus-Cre mediated conditional deletion of Ada3 in Ada3(FL/FL) mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to a severe proliferation defect which was rescued by ectopic expression of human Ada3. A delay in G(1) to S phase of cell cycle was also seen that was due to accumulation of Cdk inhibitor p27 which was an indirect effect of c-myc gene transcription control by Ada3. We further showed that this defect could be partially reverted by knocking down p27. Additionally, drastic changes in global histone acetylation and changes in global gene expression were observed in microarray analyses upon loss of Ada3. Lastly, formation of abnormal nuclei, mitotic defects and delay in G(2)/M to G(1) transition was seen in Ada3 deleted cells. Taken together, we provide evidence for a critical role of Ada3 in embryogenesis and cell cycle progression as an essential component of HAT complex.</abstract><notes>Mohibi, Shakur&#xD;Gurumurthy, Channabasavaiah Basavaraju&#xD;Nag, Alo&#xD;Wang, Jun&#xD;Mirza, Sameer&#xD;Mian, Yousaf&#xD;Quinn, Meghan&#xD;Katafiasz, Bryan&#xD;Eudy, James&#xD;Pandey, Sanjit&#xD;Guda, Chittibabu&#xD;Naramura, Mayumi&#xD;Band, Hamid&#xD;Band, Vimla&#xD;5P20RR016469/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/&#xD;5U01CA151806-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;8P20GM103427/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;CA105489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA116552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA144027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA87986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA96844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA99163/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;J Biol Chem. 2012 Aug 24;287(35):29442-56. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.378901.

Although standard platinum-based chemotherapy results in high response rates, more than 70% of patients with advanced disease will experience recurrence within 5 years. Therefore, novel treatment strategies to increase primary efficacy, decrease recurrence after primary treatment and improve the response rate for recurrent disease are needed. AREAS COVERED: This review covers antiangiogenesis therapy and the efficacy of bevacizumab as primary treatment and in platinum-sensitive and resistant recurrent disease. EXPERT OPINION: The evidence provided from Phase III trials has supported the efficacy of bevacizumab in primary and recurrent ovarian cancer management. Future investigation is needed to improve clinical performance (via biomarkers of efficacy, early discontinuation, additional agents, etc.), as well as, more sensitive tools to assess direct patient impact.</abstract><notes>CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;Review&#xD;England</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23190436 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1131</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1131</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mirkin, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interview: An interview with Chad Mirkin: nanomedicine expert.

Here we show that the same molecules inhibit growth factor-induced actin remodeling, lamellipodia formation and, ultimately, cell migration and invasion, consistent with an important role of PIP3 in these processes. In vivo, a PIT-1 analog displays significant inhibition on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) was recently identified as an important mediator of cytoskeleton and cell motility, which is regulated by PIP3-dependent membrane translocation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as ADP-ribosylation factor nucleotide binding site opener (ARNO) and general receptor for 3-phosphoinositides (GRP1). We demonstrate that PITs inhibit PIP3/ARNO or GRP1 PH domain binding and membrane localization, resulting in the inhibition of ARF6 activation. Importantly, we show that expression of the constitutively active mutant of ARF6 attenuates inhibition of lamellipodia formation and cell migration by PITs, confirming that inhibition of ARF6 contributes to inhibition of these processes by PITs. Overall, our studies demonstrate the feasibility of developing specific small-molecule targeting PIP3 binding by PH domains as potential anticancer agents that can simultaneously interfere with cancer development at multiple points.</abstract><notes>Miao, B&#xD;Skidan, I&#xD;Yang, J&#xD;You, Z&#xD;Fu, X&#xD;Famulok, M&#xD;Schaffhausen, B&#xD;Torchilin, V&#xD;Yuan, J&#xD;Degterev, A&#xD;R01 CA034722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 GM084205-01A1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Oncogene. 2012 Sep 27;31(39):4317-32. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.593.

Understanding these effects would provide a crucial tool for the rational design of drug delivery systems. While particles resembling red blood cells (RBCs) in size, shape and deformability have extended circulation times and altered biodistribution profiles compared to rigid, but otherwise similar particles, the in vivo behavior of such highly deformable particles of varied size has not been explored. We report the fabrication of a series of discoid, monodisperse, low-modulus hydrogel particles with diameters ranging from 0.8 to 8.9 mum, spanning sizes smaller than and larger than RBCs. We injected these particles into healthy mice, and tracked their concentration in the blood and their distribution into major organs. These deformable particles all demonstrated some hold up in filtration tissues like the lungs and spleen, followed by release back into the circulation, characterized by decreases in particles in these tissues with concomitant increases in particle concentration in blood. Particles similar to red blood cells in size demonstrated longer circulation times, suggesting that this size and shape of deformable particle is uniquely suited to avoid clearance.</abstract><notes>Merkel, Timothy J&#xD;Chen, Kai&#xD;Jones, Stephen W&#xD;Pandya, Ashish A&#xD;Tian, Shaomin&#xD;Napier, Mary E&#xD;Zamboni, William E&#xD;DeDimone, Joseph M&#xD;1R21HL092814-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;1R21HL096011/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;DP1 CA174425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 HL092814/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 HL096011/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Netherlands&#xD;J Control Release. 2012 Aug 20;162(1):37-44.

We demonstrated that f-NPs inhibited the production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes and further interfered with the invasiveness of cancer cells in tissue culture condition. In the tissue invasion animal model, the invasive primary tumor treated with f-NPs showed significantly less metastasis to the ectopic site along with the decreased MMP expression. In the same animal model, we observed the formation of a fibrous cage that may serve as a physical barrier capable of cancer tissue encapsulation that cuts the communication between cancer- and tumor-associated macrophages, which produce MMP enzymes. In another animal model, the blood transfer model, f-NPs potently suppressed the establishment of tumor foci in lung. Based on these data, we conclude that f-NPs have antimetastasis effects and speculate that utilization of f-NPs may provide a new strategy for the treatment of tumor metastasis. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: In this study utilizing metallofullerenol nanoparticles, the authors demonstrate antimetastasis effects and speculate that utilization of these nanoparticles may provide a new strategy in metastatic tumor therapy.</abstract><notes>Meng, Huan; Xing, Gengmei; Blanco, Elvin; Song, Yan; Zhao, Lina; Sun, Baoyun; Li, Xiaoda; Wang, Paul C; Korotcov, Alexandru; Li, Wei; Liang, Xing-Jie; Chen, Chunying; Yuan, Hui; Zhao, Feng; Chen, Zhen; Sun, Tong; Chai, Zhifang; Ferrari, Mauro; Zhao, Yuliang; 2G12RR003048/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Nanomedicine. 2012 Feb;8(2):136-46.

The development of a genomic landscape for gliomas and a better understanding of its functional consequences have led to the development of internally consistent molecular classifiers. However, development of a biologically insightful classification to guide therapy is still a work in progress. Response to targeted treatments is based not only on the presence of drugable targets, but rather on the molecular circuitry of the cells. Further, tumours are heterogeneous and change and adapt in response to drugs. Therefore, the challenge of developing molecular classifiers that provide meaningful ways to stratify patients for therapy remains a major challenge for the field. In this review, we examine the potential role of MGMT methylation, IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q deletions, aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor and PI3K pathways, abnormal p53/Rb pathways, cancer stem-cell markers and microRNAs as prognostic and predictive molecular markers in the setting of adult high-grade gliomas and we outline the clinically relevant subtypes of glioblastoma with genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic integrated analyses. Furthermore, we describe how these advances, especially in epidermal growth factor receptor/PI3K/mTOR signalling pathway, affect our approaches towards targeted therapy, raising new challenges and identifying new leads.</abstract><notes>Masui, K&#xD;Cloughesy, T F&#xD;Mischel, P S&#xD;CA108633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;NS73831/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 NS073831-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol. 2012 Jun;38(3):271-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2990.2011.01238.x.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Review</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22098029</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2990.2011.01238.x</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1132</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1132</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manus, L.

A quantitative validation of this method was done by (3)H and (111)In labeling of the nanoparticles. METHODS: The biodistribution of LCP NPs containing oligonucleotides was investigated using three different probes: Texas-Red labeled oligonucleotides, (3)H-labeled oligonucleotides, and (111)In-labled calcium phosphate. RESULTS: A discrepancy was found between the radioactivity and the fluorescence signals. Signals from (3)H and (111)In exhibited very similar distribution patterns, suggesting that liver and spleen were the major accumulation sites. However, fluorescence imaging indicated that tumor accumulation was predominant. We further confirmed that the fluorescence signals in both liver and spleen were greatly attenuated compared with those in the tumor due to the intrinsic tissue absorption and scattering. Near-infrared (NIR) dye Cy5.5 also suffered from the same problem, in that the quantitative data from whole organs was dramatically affected by absorption and scattering properties of the tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Careful attention must be paid to the quantification and interpretation of fluorescence imaging measurements when comparing different tissues.</abstract><notes>CA129421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA129835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA149363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA151455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA129835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA149363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=22806405 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1008</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1008</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, G.</author><author>Choi, K.

The ability to target collagens undergoing remodeling could lead to new diagnostics and therapeutics as well as applications in regenerative medicine; however, such collagens are often degraded and denatured, making them difficult to target with conventional approaches. Here, we present caged collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs) that can be photo-triggered to fold into triple helix and bind to collagens denatured by heat or by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) digestion. Peptide-binding assays indicate that the binding is primarily driven by stereo-selective triple-helical hybridization between monomeric CMPs of high triple-helical propensity and denatured collagen strands. Photo-triggered hybridization allows specific staining of collagen chains in protein gels as well as photo-patterning of collagen and gelatin substrates. In vivo experiments demonstrate that systemically delivered CMPs can bind to collagens in bones, as well as prominently in articular cartilages and tumors characterized by high MMP activity. We further show that CMP-based probes can detect abnormal bone growth activity in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome. This is an entirely new way to target the microenvironment of abnormal tissues and could lead to new opportunities for management of numerous pathologic conditions associated with collagen remodeling and high MMP activity.</abstract><notes>Li, Yang&#xD;Foss, Catherine A&#xD;Summerfield, Daniel D&#xD;Doyle, Jefferson J&#xD;Torok, Collin M&#xD;Dietz, Harry C&#xD;Pomper, Martin G&#xD;Yu, S Michael&#xD;AR-41135/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01-AR060484/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/&#xD;U24 CA92871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Howard Hughes Medical Institute/&#xD;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Sep 11;109(37):14767-72. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1209721109.

Although blocking HVACCs can effectively reduce pain, this treatment strategy is associated with intolerable adverse effects. Neuronal HVACCs are typically composed of alpha(1), beta (Cavbeta), and alpha(2)delta subunits. The Cavbeta subunit plays a crucial role in the membrane expression and gating properties of the pore-forming alpha(1) subunit. However, little is known about how nerve injury affects the expression and function of Cavbeta subunits in primary sensory neurons. In this study, we found that Cavbeta(3) and Cavbeta(4) are the most prominent subtypes expressed in the rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and dorsal spinal cord. Spinal nerve ligation (SNL) in rats significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of the Cavbeta(3), but not Cavbeta(4), subunit in the DRG. SNL also significantly increased HVACC currents in small DRG neurons and monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents of spinal dorsal horn neurons evoked from the dorsal root. Intrathecal injection of Cavbeta(3)-specific siRNA significantly reduced HVACC currents in small DRG neurons and the amplitude of monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents of dorsal horn neurons in SNL rats. Furthermore, intrathecal treatment with Cavbeta(3)-specific siRNA normalized mechanical hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia caused by SNL but had no significant effect on the normal nociceptive threshold. Our findings provide novel evidence that increased expression of the Cavbeta(3) subunit augments HVACC activity in primary sensory neurons and nociceptive input to dorsal horn neurons in neuropathic pain. Targeting the Cavbeta(3) subunit at the spinal level represents an effective strategy for treating neuropathic pain.</abstract><notes>Li, Li; Cao, Xue-Hong; Chen, Shao-Rui; Han, Hee-Dong; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K; Pan, Hui-Lin; CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; GM064830/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; NS045602/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; NS073935/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; J Biol Chem. 2012 Feb 17;287(8):6002-13.

An anionic lipid, dioleoylphosphatydic acid (DOPA), was employed as the inner leaflet lipid to coat the nano-size CaP cores, which entrap the siRNA, such that the coated cores were soluble in organic solvent. A suitable neutral or cationic lipid was used as the outer leaflet lipid to form an asymmetric lipid bilayer structure verified by the measurement of NP zeta potential. The resulting NP was named LCP-II with a size of about 25 to 30nm in diameter and contained a hollow core as revealed by TEM imaging. PEGylation of NP was done by including a PEG-phospholipid conjugate, with or without a targeting ligand anisamide, in the outer leaflet lipid mixture. The sub-cellular distribution studied in the sigma receptor positive human H460 lung cancer cells indicated that LCP-II could release more cargo to the cytoplasm than our previous lipid/protamine/DNA (LPD) formulation, leading to a significant (~40 fold in vitro and ~4 fold in vivo) improvement in siRNA delivery. Bio-distribution study showed that LCP-II required more PEGylation for MPS evasion than the previous LPD, probably due to increased surface curvature in LCP-II.</abstract><notes>Li, Jun; Yang, Yang; Huang, Leaf; CA129835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA149363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA129835-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA149363-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA149363-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Netherlands; J Control Release. 2012 Feb 28;158(1):108-14.

They are the primary regulators of cell-matrix interactions, with direct roles in cell motility and signaling, which in turn regulate numerous physiological processes. Under common experimental conditions, integrins tend to cluster for sturdy and effective binding to extracellular matrix molecules. These clusters often evolve into focal adhesions, which regulate downstream signaling. However, integrin clusters are more pronounced and have longer lifetimes in two-dimensional assays than in more realistic three-dimensional environments. While a number of models and theoretical approaches have focused on integrin binding and diffusion, the reasons for the differences between two- and three-dimensional clustering have remained elusive. In this study, we model an individual cluster attached to a two-dimensional collagen film and attached to collagen fibers of various sizes in three-dimensional matrices. We then discuss how our results explain differences in size and lifetime, and how they hint at reasons for other differences between the two environments. Further, we make predictions regarding the stability of clusters based on different overall intracellular conditions. Our results show good agreement with experiments and provide a quantitative basis for understanding how matrix dimensionality and structure regulate integrin behavior in environments that mimic in vivo conditions.</abstract><notes>Lepzelter, David; Bates, Oliver; Zaman, Muhammad; 1R01CA132633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; 1RC2CA147925/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R25-CA153955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Langmuir. 2012 Mar 27;28(12):5379-86.

Metronomic dosing, the frequent administration of chemotherapeutics at substantially lower than maximum tolerated doses (MTD), has been shown to result in reduced normal tissue toxicity and to minimize &quot;off-treatment&quot; exposure resulting in an improved therapeutic ratio. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We tested the hypothesis that hyaluronic acid (HA) conjugates of paclitaxel (TXL; HA-TXL) would exert strong antitumor effects with metronomic (MET) dosing and induce antiangiogenic effects superior to those achieved with MTD administration or with free TXL. Female nude mice bearing SKOV3ip1 or HeyA8 ovarian cancer cells were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with MET HA-TXL regimens (or MTD administration) to determine therapeutic and biologic effects. RESULTS: All MET HA-TXL-treated mice and the MTD group revealed significantly reduced tumor weights and nodules compared with controls (all P values &lt; 0.05) in the chemotherapy-sensitive models. However, the MTD HA-TXL-treated mice showed significant weight loss compared with control mice, whereas body weights were not affected in the metronomic groups in HeyA8-MDR model, reflecting reduced toxicity. In the taxane-resistant HeyA8-MDR model, significant reduction in tumor weight and nodule counts was noted in the metronomic groups whereas the response of the MTD group did not achieve significance. While both MTD and metronomic regimens reduced proliferation (Ki-67) and increased apoptosis (TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling), only metronomic treatment resulted in significant reductions in angiogenesis (CD31, microvessel density). Moreover, metronomic treatment resulted in substantial increases in thrombospondin-1 (Tsp-1), an inhibitor of angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that MET HA-TXL regimens have substantial antitumor activity in ovarian carcinoma, likely via a predominant antiangiogenic mechanism.</abstract><notes>Lee, Sun Joo&#xD;Ghosh, Sukhen C&#xD;Han, Hee Dong&#xD;Stone, Rebecca L&#xD;Bottsford-Miller, Justin&#xD;Shen, De Yue&#xD;Auzenne, Edmond J&#xD;Lopez-Araujo, Alejandro&#xD;Lu, Chunhua&#xD;Nishimura, Masato&#xD;Pecot, Chad V&#xD;Zand, Behrouz&#xD;Thanapprapasr, Duangmani&#xD;Jennings, Nicholas B&#xD;Kang, Yu&#xD;Huang, Jie&#xD;Hu, Wei&#xD;Klostergaard, Jim&#xD;Sood, Anil K&#xD;CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Aug 1;18(15):4114-21.

Previously we showed that the accumulation in tumors of the new PET tracer 1-(2&apos;-deoxy-2&apos;-(18)F-fluoro-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine ((18)F-FAC) is predictive of responses to gemcitabine. (18)F-FAC retention in cells requires deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), a rate-limiting enzyme in the deoxyribonucleoside salvage metabolism and in gemcitabine conversion from an inactive prodrug to a cytotoxic compound. The objectives of the current study were to determine whether (18)F-FAC tumor uptake is also influenced by cytidine deaminase (CDA), a determinant of resistance to gemcitabine; to develop a new PET assay using (18)F-FAC and the related probe 1-(2&apos;-deoxy-2&apos;-(18)F-fluoro-beta-l-arabinofuranosyl)-5-methylcytosine (l-(18)F-FMAC) to profile tumor lesions for both dCK and CDA enzymatic activities; and to determine whether this PET assay can identify the most effective NA chemotherapy against tumors with differential expression of dCK and CDA. METHODS: Isogenic murine leukemic cell lines with defined dCK and CDA activities were generated by retroviral transduction. A cell viability assay was used to determine the sensitivity of the isogenic cell lines to the dCK-dependent NA prodrugs gemcitabine and clofarabine. In vitro enzymatic and cell-based tracer uptake assays and in vivo PET with (18)F-FAC and l-(18)F-FMAC were used to predict tumor responses to gemcitabine and clofarabine. RESULTS: dCK and CDA activities measured by kinase and tracer uptake assays correlated with the sensitivity of isogenic cell lines to gemcitabine and clofarabine. Coexpression of CDA decreased the sensitivity of dCK-positive cells to gemcitabine treatment in vitro by 15-fold but did not affect responses to clofarabine. Coexpression of CDA decreased (18)F-FAC but not l-(18)F-FMAC, phosphorylation, and uptake by dCK-positive cells. (18)F-FAC and l-(18)F-FMAC PET estimates of the enzymatic activities of dCK and CDA in tumor implants in mice were predictive of responses to gemcitabine and clofarabine treatment in vivo. CONCLUSION: These findings support the utility of PET-based phenotyping of tumor nucleoside metabolism for guiding the selection of NA prodrugs.</abstract><notes>Lee, Jason T; Campbell, Dean O; Satyamurthy, Nagichettiar; Czernin, Johannes; Radu, Caius G; P50 CA86306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Nucl Med. 2012 Feb;53(2):275-80.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22302964</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.2967/jnumed.111.090407</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1439</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1439</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, J.</author><author>Sharei, A.</author><author>Sim, W.

Nanoparticles could potentially be used as delivery vehicles or as fluorescent sensors to probe the cell. In particular, quantum dots (QDs) may be used to illuminate cytosolic proteins for long-term microscopy studies. Whereas recent advances have been successful in specifically labeling proteins with QDs on the cell membrane, cytosolic delivery of QDs into live cells has remained challenging. In this report, we demonstrate high throughput delivery of QDs into live cell cytoplasm using an uncomplicated microfluidic device while maintaining cell viabilities of 80-90%. We verify that the nanoparticle surface interacts with the cytosolic environment and that the QDs remain nonaggregated so that single QDs can be observed.</abstract><notes>5-U54-CA151884-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;5R01CA126642-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;GM68762/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P30-CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA126642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;RC1 EB011187-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23145796 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1052</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1052</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, H.</author><author>Lytton-Jean, A.

However, size, shape, surface chemistry and the presentation of targeting ligands on the surface of nanoparticles can affect circulation half-life and biodistribution, cell-specific internalization, excretion, toxicity and efficacy. A variety of materials have been explored for delivering small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)--a therapeutic agent that suppresses the expression of targeted genes. However, conventional delivery nanoparticles such as liposomes and polymeric systems are heterogeneous in size, composition and surface chemistry, and this can lead to suboptimal performance, a lack of tissue specificity and potential toxicity. Here, we show that self-assembled DNA tetrahedral nanoparticles with a well-defined size can deliver siRNAs into cells and silence target genes in tumours. Monodisperse nanoparticles are prepared through the self-assembly of complementary DNA strands. Because the DNA strands are easily programmable, the size of the nanoparticles and the spatial orientation and density of cancer-targeting ligands (such as peptides and folate) on the nanoparticle surface can be controlled precisely. We show that at least three folate molecules per nanoparticle are required for optimal delivery of the siRNAs into cells and, gene silencing occurs only when the ligands are in the appropriate spatial orientation. In vivo, these nanoparticles showed a longer blood circulation time (t(1/2) approximately 24.2 min) than the parent siRNA (t(1/2) approximately 6 min).</abstract><notes>Lee, Hyukjin; Lytton-Jean, Abigail K R; Chen, Yi; Love, Kevin T; Park, Angela I; Karagiannis, Emmanouil D; Sehgal, Alfica; Querbes, William; Zurenko, Christopher S; Jayaraman, Muthusamy; Peng, Chang G; Charisse, Klaus; Borodovsky, Anna; Manoharan, Muthiah; Donahoe, Jessica S; Truelove, Jessica; Nahrendorf, Matthias; Langer, Robert; Anderson, Daniel G; EB000244/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; U54 CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Nat Nanotechnol. 2012 Jun 3;7(6):389-93. doi: 10.1038/nnano.2012.73.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22659608</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nnano.2012.73</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1135</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1135</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Launiere, C.</author><author>Gaskill, M.</author><author>Czaplewski, G.</author><author>Myung, J.

The first of two proteins, antiepithelial cell adhesion molecule (anti-EpCAM), provides the specificity for CTC capture. The second, E-selectin, increases CTC capture under shear. Patterning regions with and without E-selectin allows captured leukocytes, which also bind E-selectin and are unwanted impurities in CTC isolation, to roll a short distance and detach from the capture surface. This reduces leukocyte capture by up to 82%. The patterning is combined with a leukocyte elution step in which a calcium chelating buffer effectively deactivates E-selectin so that leukocytes may be rinsed away 60% more efficiently than with a buffer containing calcium. The alternating patterning of this biomimetic protein combination, used in conjunction with the elution step, reduces capture of leukocytes while maintaining a high tumor cell capture efficiency that is up to 1.9 times higher than the tumor cell capture efficiency of a surface with only anti-EpCAM. The new patterning technique described here does not require mask alignment and can be used to spatially control the immobilization of any two proteins or protein mixtures inside a sealed microfluidic channel.</abstract><notes>Launiere, Cari&#xD;Gaskill, Marissa&#xD;Czaplewski, Gregory&#xD;Myung, Ja Hye&#xD;Hong, Seungpyo&#xD;Eddington, David T&#xD;U54 CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151880-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Anal Chem. 2012 May 1;84(9):4022-8.

Identification of factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of PLD would enable personalization of therapy. We previously reported that age, gender, body composition, and monocytes affect the clearance of other liposomal agents. Therefore, we evaluated how these factors affect the pharmacokinetics of PLD. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic studies of PLD were performed as part of phase I and II studies in 70 patients with solid tumors or Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma. The effects of monocyte count, age, gender, and body composition on PLD clearance were examined. RESULTS: There was a 15.3-fold variability in PLD clearance. Body surface area-based dosing did not significantly reduce the variability in PLD clearance. The mean +/- SD clearance for patients &lt;60 years old and &gt;/=60 years old were 54.6 +/- 28.5 and 23.3 +/- 10.8 mL/h/m(2), respectively (P &lt; 0.0001), and for female and male patients were 23.7 +/- 18.8 and 55.6 +/- 26.8 mL/h/m(2), respectively (P &lt; 0.0001). A reduction in pre-cycle monocyte count was associated with a greater reduction in PLD clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Age, gender, and monocyte counts appear to correlate with PLD clearance. Further investigation of the association between these factors, PLD pharmacokinetics, and clinical outcomes (efficacy and toxicity) is warranted. These effects on the pharmacokinetics of PLD may be an approach for personalizing PLD therapy and may affect other pegylated liposomes and nanoparticle agents.</abstract><notes>La-Beck, Ninh M; Zamboni, Beth A; Gabizon, Alberto; Schmeeda, Hilary; Amantea, Michael; Gehrig, Paola A; Zamboni, William C; Germany; Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2012 Jan;69(1):43-50.

We found the multilayer growth and stability to be strongly pH-dependent. Silk assembled with poly(methacrylic) and tannic acids at pH=3.5 disintegrated at pH~5; while silk/poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) interactions were stable at low and high pH values but resulting in thinner films at high pH. The results suggest that the intermolecular interactions are primary driven by hydrogen bonding with a considerable contribution of hydrophobic forces. We also demonstrated that cubical, spherical and platelet capsules with silk-containing walls can be constructed using particulate sacrificial templates.

Hallmarks of GBM tumors include soaring proliferative indices, high levels of angiogenesis, diffuse invasion into normal brain parenchyma, resistance toward therapy-induced apoptosis, and pseudopallisading necrosis. Despite the recent advances in neurosurgery, radiation therapy, and the development of targeted chemotherapeutic regimes, GBM remains one of the deadliest types of cancer. Particularly, the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) in combination with radiation therapy prolonged patient survival only marginally, and clinical studies assessing efficacies of targeted therapies, foremost ATP mimetics inhibiting the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), revealed only few initial responders; tumor recurrence is nearly universal, and salvage therapies to combat such progression remain ineffective. Consequently, myriad preclinical and clinical studies began to define the molecular mechanisms underlying therapy resistance of GBM tumors, and pointed to the Bcl-2 protein family, in particular the atypical member Bcl2-Like 12 (Bcl2L12), as important regulators of therapy-induced cell death. This review will discuss the multi-faceted modi operandi of Bcl-2 family proteins, describe their roles in therapy resistance of malignant glioma, and outline current and future drug development efforts to therapeutically target Bcl-2 proteins.</abstract><notes>Kouri, Fotini M; Jensen, Samuel A; Stegh, Alexander H; 5R00CA129172-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32CA09560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; ScientificWorldJournal. 2012;2012:838916.

Two-dimensional tomographic images and 3-D volumetric images of the objects placed at different depths are presented. In addition, we studied the sensitivity of CMUT-based PAI to the concentration of indocyanine green dye at 5 cm depth inside the phantom. Under optimized experimental conditions, the objects at 5 cm depth can be imaged with SNR of about 35 dB and a spatial resolution of approximately 500 μm.

The immuno-modification of either the drug or DDS has proven to be a very promising approach that has significantly improved the targeted accumulation in pathological sites while decreasing its undesirable side effects in healthy tissues. The arrangement for both prolonged life in the circulation and specific target recognition represents another potent strategy in the development of immuno-targeted systems. The longevity of immuno-targeted DDS such as immunoliposomes and immunomicelles improves their targetability even in the presence of the additional passive accumulation in areas with a compromised vasculature. The added use of the immuno-targeted systems takes advantage of the specific microenvironment of pathological sites including lowered pH, increased temperature, and variation in the enzymatic activity. &quot;Smart&quot; stimulus-responsive systems combine different valuable functionalities including PEG-protection, targeting antibody, cell-penetration, and stimulus-sensitive functions.

Current imaging methods are often limited by inadequate sensitivity, specificity and spatial resolution. Here we show that a unique triple-modality magnetic resonance imaging-photoacoustic imaging-Raman imaging nanoparticle (termed here MPR nanoparticle) can accurately help delineate the margins of brain tumors in living mice both preoperatively and intraoperatively. The MPRs were detected by all three modalities with at least a picomolar sensitivity both in vitro and in living mice. Intravenous injection of MPRs into glioblastoma-bearing mice led to MPR accumulation and retention by the tumors, with no MPR accumulation in the surrounding healthy tissue, allowing for a noninvasive tumor delineation using all three modalities through the intact skull. Raman imaging allowed for guidance of intraoperative tumor resection, and a histological correlation validated that Raman imaging was accurately delineating the brain tumor margins. This new triple-modality-nanoparticle approach has promise for enabling more accurate brain tumor imaging and resection.</abstract><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504484</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>nm.2721 [pii]; &#xD;10.1038/nm.2721</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>881</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">881</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>King, C.

METHODS: HCT116 cells were treated with IC(50) doses of Debio 0507 or oxaliplatin for 3 days. Total cellular Pt-DNA adducts were determined by ICP-MS. The DNA was digested, and the major Pt-DNA adducts formed by both drugs were characterized by UPLC/MS/MS essentially as described previously for cisplatin (Baskerville-Abraham et al. in Chem Res Toxicol 22:905-912, 2009). RESULTS: The Pt level/deoxynucleotide was 7.4/10(4) for DNA from Debio 0507-treated cells and 5.5/10(4) for oxaliplatin-treated cells following a 3-day treatment at the IC(50) for each drug. UPLC-MS/MS in the positive ion mode confirmed the major Pt-DNA adducts formed by both drugs were dach-Pt-d(GpG) (904.2 m/z --&gt; 610 m/z and 904.2 m/z --&gt; 459 m/z) and dach-Pt-d(ApG) (888.2 m/z --&gt; 594 m/z and 888.2 m/z --&gt; 459 m/z). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the major DNA adducts formed by Debio 0507 are the dach-Pt-d(GpG) and dach-Pt-d(ApG) adducts and at equitoxic doses Debio 0507 and oxaliplatin form similar levels of dach-Pt-d(GpG) and dach-Pt-d(ApG) adducts. This suggests that the action mechanisms of Debio 0507 and oxaliplatin are similar at a cellular level.</abstract><notes>King, C L; Ramachandran, S; Chaney, S G; Collins, L; Swenberg, J A; DeKrafft, K E; Lin, W; Cicurel, L; Barbier, M; P30-ES10126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/; Germany; Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2012 Mar;69(3):665-77.

We have developed a nanoparticle (NP) composed of lipid (DOTAP/DOPE) and apolipoprotein (APOA-I) to mediate the targeted delivery of intracellular-acting protein drugs to non-small cell lung tumors. NPs were produced with either GFP, a fluorescent model protein, or cytochrome C (cytC), an inducer of apoptosis in cancer cells. GFP and cytC were separately conjugated with a membrane permeable sequence (MPS) peptide and were admixed with DOPE/DOTAP nanoparticle formulations to enable successful protein loading. Protein-loaded NPs were modified with DSPE-PEG-Anisamide to enable specific NP targeting to the tumor site in a xenograft model. The resulting particle was 20-30 nm in size and exhibited a 64-75% loading efficiency. H460 cells treated with the PEGylated MPS-cytC-NPs exhibited massive apoptosis. When MPS-GFP-NPs or MPS-cytC-NPs were intravenously administered in H460 tumor bearing mice, a specific tumor targeting effect with low NP accumulation in the liver was observed. In addition, MPS-cytC-NP treatment provoked a tumor growth retardation effect in H460 xenograft mice. We conclude that our NP enables targeted, efficacious therapeutic protein delivery for the treatment of lung cancer.</abstract><notes>Kim, Sang Kyoon; Foote, Michael B; Huang, Leaf; CA129835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA149363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Biomaterials. 2012 May;33(15):3959-66.

To investigate whether transplanted hGPs can affect the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of transplanted hGPs together with the in vivo fate of these cells using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bioluminescence imaging (BLI). At 14 days post-EAE induction, mice (n = 19) were intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injected with 5 x 10(5) hGPs that were magnetically labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles as MR contrast agent and transduced with firefly luciferase for BLI of cell survival. Control mice (n = 18) received phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vehicle only. The severity of EAE clinical disability in the hGP-transplanted group was significantly suppressed (P &lt; 0.05) with concomitant inhibition of ConA and MOG-specific T cell proliferation in the spleen. Astrogliosis was reduced and a lower activity of macrophages and/or microglia was observed in the spinal cord (P &lt; 0.05). On MRI, SPIO signal was detected within the lateral ventricle from 1 day post-transplantation and remained there for up to 34 days. BLI indicated that most cells did not survive beyond 5-10 days, consistent with the lack of detectable migration into the brain parenchyma and the histological presence of an abundance of apoptotic cells. Transplanted hGPs could not be detected in the spleen. We conclude that ICV transplantation of short-lived hGPs can have a remote therapeutic effect through immunomodulation from within the ventricle, without cells directly participating in remyelination.</abstract><notes>Kim, Heechul&#xD;Walczak, Piotr&#xD;Muja, Naser&#xD;Campanelli, James T&#xD;Bulte, Jeff W M&#xD;2R01 NS045062/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Glia. 2012 Jul;60(7):1117-29. doi: 10.1002/glia.22339.

Here, we report the development of a novel heptameric targeting system, with general applications, constructed by fusing a target-binding domain with the heptamerization domain of the Archaeal RNA binding protein Sm1 through a flexible hinge peptide. The previously reported affibody molecules against EGFR and HER2, Z(EGFR) and Z(HER2), were used as target binding moieties. The fusion molecules were highly expressed in E. coli as soluble proteins and efficiently self-assembled into multimeric targeting ligands with the heptamer as the predominant form. We demonstrated that the heptameric molecules were resistant to protease-mediated digestion or heat- and SDS-induced denaturation. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis showed that both heptameric Z(EGFR) and Z(HER2) ligands have a significantly enhanced binding strength to their target receptors with a nearly 100 to 1000 fold increase relative to the monomeric ligands. Cellular binding assays showed that heptameric ligands maintained their target-binding specificities similar to the monomeric forms towards their respective receptor. The non-toxic property of each heptameric ligand was demonstrated by the cell proliferation assay. In general,, the heptamerization strategy we describe here could be applied to the facile and efficient engineering of other protein domain- or short peptide-based affinity molecules to acquire significantly improved target-binding strengths with potential applications in the targeted delivery of various imaging or therapeutic agents..</abstract><notes>Kim, Dongwook&#xD;Yan, Yitang&#xD;Valencia, C Alexander&#xD;Liu, Rihe&#xD;CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e43077. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0043077.

STUDY DESIGN: Dual-labeled 50-nm and 100-nm eNP were prepared by encapsulating an IR-813 near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye within coumarin-conjugated expansile polymer nanoparticles (NIR-C-eNP). NIR imaging and fluorescent microscopy were used to identify intralymphatic migration of NIR-nanoparticles to draining inguinal or mesenteric LN after injection in swine hind legs or intestine. Nanoparticle-mediated intranodal delivery of chemotherapy was subsequently assessed with Oregon Green paclitaxel-loaded NIR-eNP (NIR-OGpax-eNP). RESULTS: NIR imaging demonstrated direct lymphatic migration of 50-nm, but not 100-nm, NIR-C-eNP and NIR-OGpax-eNP to the draining regional LNs after intradermal injection in the hind leg or subserosal injection in intestine. Fluorescent microscopy demonstrated that IR-813 used for NIR real-time trafficking colocalized with both the coumarin-labeled polymer and paclitaxel chemotherapy and was identified within the subcapsular spaces of the draining LNs. These studies verify nodal migration of both nanoparticle and encapsulated payload, and confirm the feasibility of focusing chemotherapy delivery directly to regional nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Regionally-targeted intranodal chemotherapy can be delivered to draining LNs for both skin and solid organs using 50-nm paclitaxel-loaded eNP.</abstract><notes>Khullar, Onkar V; Griset, Aaron P; Gibbs-Strauss, Summer L; Chirieac, Lucian R; Zubris, Kimberly A V; Frangioni, John V; Grinstaff, Mark W; Colson, Yolonda L; R01-CA-115296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R25CA153955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32CA009535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Am Coll Surg. 2012 Mar;214(3):328-37.

The nanoparticles possess a constant width of 80 nm, and we varied their lengths ranging from 180 to 5000 nm. In addition to varying the aspect ratio of the particles, the deformability of the particles was tuned by varying the cross-link density within the particle matrix. Size characteristics such as hydrodynamic diameter and persistence length of the particles were analyzed using dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy techniques, respectively, while particle deformability was assessed by atomic force microscopy. Additionally, the ability of the particles to pass through membranes containing 0.2 mum pores was assessed by means of a simple filtration technique, and particle recovery was determined using fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that particle recovery is mostly independent of aspect ratio at all cross-linker concentrations utilized, with the exception of 96 wt % PEG diacrylate 80 x 5000 nm particles, which showed the lowest percent recovery.</abstract><notes>Kersey, Farrell R&#xD;Merkel, Timothy J&#xD;Perry, Jillian L&#xD;Napier, Mary E&#xD;DeSimone, Joseph M&#xD;1DP1OD006432/OD/NIH HHS/&#xD;DP1 CA174425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;DP1 OD006432/OD/NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 HL092814/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;R21H2092814/PHS HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Langmuir. 2012 Jun 12;28(23):8773-81.

Exhibiting high compatibility with organic solvents and the ability to carry out sophisticated actuation and sensing of reaction droplets, EWOD is a unique platform for performing diverse microscale chemical syntheses in small volumes, including multistep processes with intermediate solvent-exchange steps.</abstract><notes>Keng, Pei Yuin; Chen, Supin; Ding, Huijiang; Sadeghi, Saman; Shah, Gaurav J; Dooraghi, Alex; Phelps, Michael E; Satyamurthy, Nagichettiar; Chatziioannou, Arion F; Kim, Chang-Jin; van Dam, R Michael; R25CA098010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Jan 17;109(3):690-5.

However, current nanomedicine research has been focused on the delivery of established and novel therapeutics. Here we demonstrate proof of the principle of using NPs to revive the clinical potential of abandoned compounds using wortmannin (Wtmn) as a model drug. Wtmn is a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3&apos; kinase-related kinases but failed clinical translation due to drug-delivery challenges. We engineered a NP formulation of Wtmn and demonstrated that NP Wtmn has higher solubility and lower toxicity compared with Wtmn. To establish the clinical translation potential of NP Wtmn, we evaluated the therapeutic as a radiosensitizer in vitro and in vivo. NP Wtmn was found to be a potent radiosensitizer and was significantly more effective than the commonly used radiosensitizer cisplatin in vitro in three cancer cell lines. The mechanism of action of NP Wtmn radiosensitization was found to be through the inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. Finally, NP Wtmn was shown to be an effective radiosensitizer in vivo using two murine xenograft models of cancer. Our results demonstrate that NP drug-delivery systems can promote the readoption of abandoned drugs such as Wtmn by overcoming drug-delivery challenges.</abstract><notes>Karve, Shrirang&#xD;Werner, Michael E&#xD;Sukumar, Rohit&#xD;Cummings, Natalie D&#xD;Copp, Jonathan A&#xD;Wang, Edina C&#xD;Li, Chenxi&#xD;Sethi, Manish&#xD;Chen, Ronald C&#xD;Pacold, Michael E&#xD;Wang, Andrew Z&#xD;1-U54-CA151652-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;5-K12-CA120780-01-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 May 22;109(21):8230-5.

Serum and tumor cell surface proteins whose abundance, or change in abundance in response to therapy, differentiates patients responding to a therapy from patients not responding to a therapy could be usefully incorporated into tools for monitoring response. Here, we posit and then verify that proteomic discovery in in vitro tissue culture models can identify proteins with concordant in vivo behavior and further, can be a valuable approach for identifying tumor-derived serum proteins. In this study, we use stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) with proteomic technologies to quantitatively analyze the gefitinib-related protein changes in a model system for sensitivity to EGF receptor (EGFR)-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We identified 3,707 intracellular proteins, 1,276 cell surface proteins, and 879 shed proteins. More than 75% of the proteins identified had quantitative information, and a subset consisting of 400 proteins showed a statistically significant change in abundance following gefitinib treatment. We validated the change in expression profile in vitro and screened our panel of response markers in an in vivo isogenic resistant model and showed that these were markers of gefitinib response and not simply markers of phospho-EGFR downregulation. In doing so, we also were able to identify which proteins might be useful as markers for monitoring response and which proteins might be useful as markers for a priori prediction of response.</abstract><notes>Kani, Kian&#xD;Faca, Vitor M&#xD;Hughes, Lindsey D&#xD;Zhang, Wenxuan&#xD;Fang, Qiaojun&#xD;Shahbaba, Babak&#xD;Luethy, Roland&#xD;Erde, Jonathan&#xD;Schmidt, Joanna&#xD;Pitteri, Sharon J&#xD;Zhang, Qing&#xD;Katz, Jonathan E&#xD;Gross, Mitchell E&#xD;Plevritis, Sylvia K&#xD;McIntosh, Martin W&#xD;Jain, Anjali&#xD;Hanash, Samir&#xD;Agus, David B&#xD;Mallick, Parag&#xD;1U54CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;5U54CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;5U54CA143907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 May;11(5):1071-81.

These materials have evolved from their earlier use as biodegradable products such as resorbable sutures, orthopaedic implants, macroscale and microscale drug delivery systems such as microparticles and wafers used as controlled drug release depots, to multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) capable of targeting, and controlled release of therapeutic and diagnostic agents. These newer generations of targeted and controlled release polymeric NPs are now engineered to navigate the complex in vivo environment, and incorporate functionalities for achieving target specificity, control of drug concentration and exposure kinetics at the tissue, cell, and subcellular levels. Indeed this optimization of drug pharmacology as aided by careful design of multifunctional NPs can lead to improved drug safety and efficacy, and may be complimentary to drug enhancements that are traditionally achieved by medicinal chemistry. In this regard, polymeric NPs have the potential to result in a highly differentiated new class of therapeutics, distinct from the original active drugs used in their composition, and distinct from first generation NPs that largely facilitated drug formulation. A greater flexibility in the design of drug molecules themselves may also be facilitated following their incorporation into NPs, as drug properties (solubility, metabolism, plasma binding, biodistribution, target tissue accumulation) will no longer be constrained to the same extent by drug chemical composition, but also become in-part the function of the physicochemical properties of the NP. The combination of optimally designed drugs with optimally engineered polymeric NPs opens up the possibility of improved clinical outcomes that may not be achievable with the administration of drugs in their conventional form. In this critical review, we aim to provide insights into the design and development of targeted polymeric NPs and to highlight the challenges associated with the engineering of this novel class of therapeutics, including considerations of NP design optimization, development and biophysicochemical properties. Additionally, we highlight some recent examples from the literature, which demonstrate current trends and novel concepts in both the design and utility of targeted polymeric NPs (444 references).</abstract><notes>Kamaly, Nazila; Xiao, Zeyu; Valencia, Pedro M; Radovic-Moreno, Aleksandar F; Farokhzad, Omid C; CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB003647/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; HHSN268201000045C/PHS HHS/; England; Chem Soc Rev. 2012 Apr 7;41(7):2971-3010.

However, the mechanisms of tau aggregation and toxicity remain unknown. Recent work has shown that anionic lipid membranes can induce tau aggregation and that membrane permeabilization may serve as a pathway by which protein aggregates exert toxicity, suggesting that the plasma membrane may play dual roles in tau pathology. This prompted our investigation to assess tau&apos;s propensity to interact with membranes and to elucidate the mutually disruptive structural perturbations the interactions induce in both tau and the membrane. We show that although highly charged and soluble, the full-length tau (hTau40) is also highly surface active, selectively inserts into anionic DMPG lipid monolayers and induces membrane morphological changes. To resolve molecular-scale structural details of hTau40 associated with lipid membranes, X-ray and neutron scattering techniques are utilized. X-ray reflectivity indicates hTau40s presence underneath a DMPG monolayer and penetration into the lipid headgroups and tailgroups, whereas grazing incidence X-ray diffraction shows that hTau40 insertion disrupts lipid packing. Moreover, both air/water and DMPG lipid membrane interfaces induce the disordered hTau40 to partially adopt a more compact conformation with density similar to that of a folded protein. Neutron reflectivity shows that tau completely disrupts supported DMPG bilayers while leaving the neutral DPPC bilayer intact. Our results show that hTau40s strong interaction with anionic lipids induces tau structural compaction and membrane disruption, suggesting possible membrane-based mechanisms of tau aggregation and toxicity in neurodegenerative diseases.</abstract><notes>Jones, Emmalee M; Dubey, Manish; Camp, Phillip J; Vernon, Briana C; Biernat, Jacek; Mandelkow, Eckhard; Majewski, Jaroslaw; Chi, Eva Y; Biochemistry. 2012 Mar 27;51(12):2539-50.

Techniques with real-time content to guide and quantitate cell implantation are especially important in applications such as musculoskeletal regenerative medicine. Here, we report the use of silica-coated gold nanorods as a contrast agent for photoacoustic imaging and quantitation of mesenchymal stem cells in rodent muscle tissue. The silica coating increased the uptake of gold into the cell more than 5-fold, yet no toxicity or proliferation changes were observed in cells loaded with this contrast agent. Pluripotency of the cells was retained, and secretome analysis indicated that only IL-6 was disregulated more than 2-fold from a pool of 26 cytokines. The low background of the technique allowed imaging of down to 100,000 cells in vivo. The spatial resolution is 340 mum, and the temporal resolution is 0.2 s, which is at least an order of magnitude below existing cell imaging approaches. This approach has significant advantages over traditional cell imaging techniques like positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging including real time monitoring of stem cell therapy.</abstract><notes>Jokerst, Jesse V&#xD;Thangaraj, Mridhula&#xD;Kempen, Paul J&#xD;Sinclair, Robert&#xD;Gambhir, Sanjiv S&#xD;CCNE U54 CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;ICMIC P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;SMIS R25-T CA118681/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;ACS Nano. 2012 Jul 24;6(7):5920-30. doi: 10.1021/nn302042y.

Here, we propose a combined photoacoustic (PA)/Raman approach using gold nanorods (GNRs) as a passively targeted molecular imaging agent. GNRs with three different aspect ratios were studied. Those with an aspect ratio of 3.5 were selected for their highest ex vivo and in vivo PA signal and used to image subcutaneous xenografts of the 2008, HEY, and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines in living mice. Maximum PA signal was observed within 3 h for all three lines tested and increased signal persisted for at least two days postadministration. There was a linear relationship (R(2) = 0.95) between the PA signal and the concentration of injected molecular imaging agent with a calculated limit of detection of 0.40 nM GNRs in the 2008 cell line. The same molecular imaging agent could be used for clear visualization of the margin between tumor and normal tissue and tumor debulking via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) imaging. Finally, we validated the imaging findings with biodistribution data and elemental analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of in vivo imaging of ovarian cancer tumors with a photoacoustic and Raman imaging agent.</abstract><notes>P30 CA124435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R25 CA118681/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R25-T CA118681/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23101432 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1144</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1144</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Janowski, M.</author><author>Bulte, J.

Generation of patient-specific stem cells exemplifies the efforts toward this new approach. Cell-based therapy is a highly promising treatment paradigm; however, due to the lack of consistent and unbiased data about the fate of stem cells in vivo, interpretation of therapeutic effects remains challenging hampering the progress in this field. The advent of nanotechnology with a wide palette of inorganic and organic nanostructures has expanded the arsenal of methods for tracking transplanted stem cells. The diversity of nanomaterials has revolutionized personalized nanomedicine and enables individualized tailoring of stem cell labeling materials for the specific needs of each patient. The successful implementation of stem cell tracking will likely be a significant driving force that will contribute to the further development of nanotheranostics.

In this review, we focus specifically on molecular imaging of intact living subjects. We provide a basic primer for those who are new to molecular imaging, and a resource for those involved in the field. We begin by describing classical molecular imaging techniques together with their key strengths and limitations, after which we introduce some of the latest emerging imaging modalities. We provide an overview of the main classes of molecular imaging agents (i.e., small molecules, peptides, aptamers, engineered proteins, and nanoparticles) and cite examples of how molecular imaging is being applied in oncology, neuroscience, cardiology, gene therapy, cell tracking, and theranostics (therapy combined with diagnostics). A step-by-step guide to answering biological and/or clinical questions using the tools of molecular imaging is also provided. We conclude by discussing the grand challenges of the field, its future directions, and enormous potential for further impacting how we approach research and medicine.</abstract><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22535898</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>92/2/897 [pii]; &#xD;10.1152/physrev.00049.2010</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1103</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1103</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jaganathan, H.</author><author>Godin, B.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Department of Nanomedicine, The Methodist Hospital Research Institute, Houston, TX, USA.</auth-address><titles><title>Biocompatibility assessment of Si-based nano- and micro-particles</title><secondary-title>Adv Drug Deliv Rev</secondary-title><alt-title>Advanced drug delivery reviews</alt-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Adv Drug Deliv Rev</full-title><abbr-1>Advanced drug delivery reviews</abbr-1></periodical><alt-periodical><full-title>Adv Drug Deliv Rev</full-title><abbr-1>Advanced drug delivery reviews</abbr-1></alt-periodical><pages>1800-19</pages><volume>64</volume><number>15</number><edition>2012/05/29</edition><keywords><keyword>CA151668</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>Dec</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1872-8294 (Electronic)&#xD;0169-409X (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>22634160</accession-num><abstract>Silicon is one of the most abundant chemical elements found on the Earth.

Nanomedical technologies are evolving at a rapid pace and are poised to play a vital role in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions - the so-called &quot;theranostics&quot; - with potential to advance personalized medicine. In this regard, nanoparticulate delivery systems can be designed with tumor seeking characteristics by utilizing the inherent abnormalities and leaky vasculature of solid tumors or custom engineered with targeting ligands for more specific tumor drug targeting. In this review we discuss some of the recent advances made in the development of multifunctional polymeric nanosystems with an emphasis on image-guided drug and gene delivery. Multifunctional nanosystems incorporate variety of payloads (anticancer drugs and genes), imaging agents (optical probes, radio-ligands, and contrast agents), and targeting ligands (antibodies and peptides) for multi-pronged cancer intervention with potential to report therapeutic outcomes. Through advances in combinatorial polymer synthesis and high-throughput testing methods, rapid progress in novel optical/radiolabeling strategies, and the technological breakthroughs in instrumentation, such as hybrid molecular and functional imaging systems, there is tremendous future potential in clinical utility of theranostic nanosystems.</abstract><notes>Iyer, A K; He, J; Amiji, M M; Netherlands; Curr Med Chem. 2012 Jul 1;19(19):3230-40.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22612697</url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1413</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1413</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ivan, C.</author><author>Hu, W.</author><author>Bottsford-Miller, J.</author><author>Zand, B.</author><author>Dalton, H.

We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to study the clinical relevance of epigenetic modifications of Notch superfamily genes. METHODS: We analyzed the interaction of DNA methylation and miRNAs with gene expression data for Notch superfamily members with the Spearman rank correlation test and explored potential relationships with overall survival (OS) with the log-rank test. We downloaded clinical data, level 3 gene expression data, and level 3 DNA methylation data for 480 patients with stage II-IV HGS-OvCa from the TCGA data portal. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts for survival analyses. In each set, patients were grouped into percentiles according to methylation and microRNA (miRNA) or messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. We used several algorithms to predict miRNA-mRNA interaction. RESULTS: There were significant inverse relationships between methylation status and mRNA expression for PPARG, CCND1, and RUNX1. For each of these genes, patients with a lower methylation level and higher expression level had significantly poorer OS than did patients with a higher methylation level and lower expression level. We also found a significant inverse relationship between miRNAs and mRNA expression for CCND1, PPARG, and RUNX1. By further analyzing the effect of miRNAs on gene expression and OS, we found that patients with higher levels of CCND1, PPARG, and RUNX1 expression and lower expression levels of their respective miRNAs (502-5p, 128, and 215/625) had significantly poorer OS.

Recently, anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy has been introduced for TNBC patients. We engineered a novel nanobioconjugate based on a poly(beta-L-malic acid) (PMLA) nanoplatform for TNBC treatment. The nanobioconjugate carries anti-tumor nucleosome-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2C5 to target breast cancer cells, anti-mouse transferrin receptor (TfR) antibody for drug delivery through the host endothelial system, and Morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (AON) to inhibit EGFR synthesis. The nanobioconjugates variants were: (1) P (BioPolymer) with AON, 2C5 and anti-TfR for tumor endothelial and cancer cell targeting, and EGFR suppression (P/AON/2C5/TfR), and (2) P with AON and 2C5 (P/AON/2C5). Controls included (3) P with 2C5 but without AON (P/2C5), (4) PBS, and (5) P with PEG and leucine ester (LOEt) for endosomal escape (P/mPEG/LOEt). Drugs were injected intravenously to MDA-MB-468 TNBC bearing mice. Tissue accumulation of injected nanobioconjugates labeled with Alexa Fluor 680 was examined by Xenogen IVIS 200 (live imaging) and confocal microscopy of tissue sections. Levels of EGFR, phosphorylated and total Akt in tumor samples were detected by western blotting. In vitro western blot showed that the leading nanobioconjugate P/AON/2C5/TfR inhibited EGFR synthesis significantly better than naked AON. In vivo imaging revealed that 2C5 increased drug-tumor accumulation. Significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in mice treated with the lead nanobioconjugate (1) [P = 0.03 vs. controls; P&lt;0.05 vs. nanobioconjugate variant (2)]. Lead nanobioconjugate (1) also showed stronger inhibition of EGFR expression and Akt phosphorylation than other treatments. Treatment of TNBC with the new nanobioconjugate results in tumor growth arrest by inhibiting EGFR and its downstream signaling intermediate, phosphorylated Akt. The nanobioconjugate represents a new generation of nanodrugs for treatment of TNBC.</abstract><notes>Inoue, Satoshi&#xD;Patil, Rameshwar&#xD;Portilla-Arias, Jose&#xD;Ding, Hui&#xD;Konda, Bindu&#xD;Espinoza, Andres&#xD;Mongayt, Dmitriy&#xD;Markman, Janet L&#xD;Elramsisy, Adam&#xD;Phillips, H Westley&#xD;Black, Keith L&#xD;Holler, Eggehard&#xD;Ljubimova, Julia Y&#xD;R01 CA CA136841/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA123495/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA136841-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31070.

We developed a new multimode optical imaging system designed to be application-versatile, yielding high sensitivity, and specificity molecular imaging. PROCEDURES: We integrated several optical imaging technologies, including fluorescence intensity, spectral, lifetime, intravital confocal, two-photon excitation, and bioluminescence, into a single system that enables functional multiscale imaging in animal models. RESULTS: The approach offers a comprehensive imaging platform for kinetic, quantitative, and environmental analysis of highly relevant information, with micro-to-macroscopic resolution. Applied to small animals in vivo, this provides superior monitoring of processes of interest, represented here by chemo-/nanoconstruct therapy assessment. CONCLUSIONS: This new system is versatile and can be optimized for various applications, of which cancer detection and targeted treatment are emphasized here.</abstract><notes>Hwang, Jae Youn&#xD;Wachsmann-Hogiu, Sebastian&#xD;Ramanujan, V Krishnan&#xD;Ljubimova, Julia&#xD;Gross, Zeev&#xD;Gray, Harry B&#xD;Medina-Kauwe, Lali K&#xD;Farkas, Daniel L&#xD;1R01 CA129822)/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;1R01 CA140995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;1U01CA151815-0/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;5R01CA123495-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;N01-CO 07119/CO/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA123495/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA129822-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA140995-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U01 CA151815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Mol Imaging Biol. 2012 Aug;14(4):431-42. doi: 10.1007/s11307-011-0517-z.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21874388</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3487699</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11307-011-0517-z</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1328</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1328</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huxford, R.C.</author><author>deKrafft, K.E. </author><author>Boyle, W.S.</author><author>Liu, D.</author><author>Lin, W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lipid-coated nanoscale coordination polymers for targeted delivery of antifolates to cancer cells</title><secondary-title>Chemical Science</secondary-title></titles><pages>198</pages><volume>3</volume><dates><year>2012</year></dates><urls><related-urls><url>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2012/SC/C1SC00499A</url></related-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1197</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1197</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huxford, Rachel C.</author><author>deKrafft, Kathryn E.</author><author>Boyle, William S.</author><author>Liu, Demin</author><author>Lin, Wenbin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lipid-coated nanoscale coordination polymers for targeted delivery of antifolates to cancer cells</title><secondary-title>Chemical Science</secondary-title></titles><pages>198-204</pages><volume>3</volume><number>1</number><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>The Royal Society of Chemistry</publisher><isbn>2041-6520</isbn><abstract>Nanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs) have been demonstrated as an interesting platform for drug delivery, as they possess many advantages over small-molecule chemotherapeutics such as high payloads, lower systemic toxicity, tunability, and enhanced tumor uptake. Existing formulations for the delivery of methotrexate (MTX), an antifolate cancer drug, have very low drug loadings. Herein, we report the incorporation of MTX as a building block in an NCP formulation with exceptionally high drug loadings (up to 79.1 wt%) and the selective delivery of the NCP to cancer cells. Encapsulation of the NCP in a functionalized lipid bilayer allows for targeted delivery and controlled release to cancer cells. A phosphor can be doped into the NCPs for monitoring particle uptake by optical imaging. The lipid-coated and anisamide-targeted NCPs have superior in vitro efficacy against acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells when compared to the free drug.</abstract><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C1SC00499A</url></related-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1108</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1108</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hussein, Y.

We examined the clinical and biological significance of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 expression in triple-negative breast cancers. Tissue microarrays were constructed with invasive breast cancer cases and stained with the enhancer of zeste homolog 2, cytokeratin 5/6, epidermal growth factor receptor 1, and p53. The expression of these markers was correlated with clinicopathologic variables and patients&apos; outcome. Furthermore, in vivo enhancer of zeste homolog 2 gene silencing was achieved using small interfering RNA incorporated into chitosan nanoparticles. Of 261 cases of invasive breast cancer, high expression of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 was detected in 87 (33%) cases, and it was strongly associated with a triple-negative breast cancer phenotype (P &lt; .001) compared with all other non-triple-negative breast cancers. Furthermore, high enhancer of zeste homolog 2 was significantly associated with high histologic grade (P = .01), estrogen receptor negativity (P &lt; .001), progesterone receptor negativity (P &lt; .001), epidermal growth factor receptor positivity (P = .04), and high p53 expression (P &lt; .001). Survival analysis demonstrated that patients with high enhancer of zeste homolog 2 had a poorer overall survival compared with those with low enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (P = .03), and it retained its significance as an independent prognostic factor (P = .02). In addition, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 gene silencing resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth (P &lt; .01) in the orthotopic MB-231 mouse model of breast carcinoma. Our results show that high enhancer of zeste homolog 2 expression is significantly associated with triple-negative breast cancer and decreased survival. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 may represent a potential therapeutic target for this aggressive disease, which warrants further investigation.</abstract><notes>Hussein, Yaser R&#xD;Sood, Anil K&#xD;Bandyopadhyay, Sudeshna&#xD;Albashiti, Bassam&#xD;Semaan, Assaad&#xD;Nahleh, Zeina&#xD;Roh, Juwon&#xD;Han, Hee Dong&#xD;Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel&#xD;Ali-Fehmi, Rouba&#xD;BC085265/BC/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Hum Pathol. 2012 Oct;43(10):1638-44. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2011.12.004.

In this work, we synthesized and characterized three degradable functional polyesters belonging to the poly(malic acid) family: the poly(benzyl malate) (PMLABe), the poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(benzyl malate) (PEG(42)-b-PMLABe), the biotin-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(benzyl malate) (Biot-PEG(62)-PMLABe). Starting from these building blocks, we were able to prepare the corresponding well-defined degradable functional nanoparticles whose toxicity was evaluated in vitro on normal and cancer cell lines. Results have evidenced that the prepared nanoparticles did not show any significant cytotoxicity even at high concentrations. A model anti-cancer drug (doxorubicin, Dox) or a fluorescent probe (1,1&apos;-dioctadecyl-3,3,3&apos;,3&apos;-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, DiD oil) has been encapsulated into PMLABe, PEG(42)-PMLABe or Biot-PEG(62)-PMLABe based nanoparticles in order to evaluate, respectively, the in vitro cytotoxicity of Dox-loaded nanoparticles on normal and cancer cell lines and the ligand (biotin) effect on cellular uptake in vitro using mmt 060562 cell line. Dox-loaded PMLABe, PEG(42)-PMLABe or Biot-PEG(62)-PMLABe nanoparticles showed an in vitro cytotoxicity similar to that of free Dox. Moreover, the DiD oil loaded Biot-PEG(62)-PMLABe based nanoparticles showed a better in vitro cellular uptake than ligand-free DiD oil loaded nanoparticles. Both results evidence the great potential of such degradable functional poly(malic acid) derivatives for the design of highly efficient site-specific anti-cancer nanovectors.</abstract><notes>Huang, Zhi Wei; Laurent, Veronique; Chetouani, Ghizlane; Ljubimova, Julia Y; Holler, Eggehard; Benvegnu, Thierry; Loyer, Pascal; Cammas-Marion, Sandrine; Netherlands; Int J Pharm. 2012 Feb 14;423(1):84-92.

Because their biocompatibility and toxicity are well investigated and better understood, magnetic nanoparticles, especially iron oxide nanoparticles, are better suited materials as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and for image-directed delivery of therapeutics. Given tunable magnetic properties and various surface chemistries from the coating materials, most applications of engineered magnetic nanoparticles take advantages of their superb MRI contrast enhancing capability as well as surface functionalities. It has been found that MRI contrast enhancement by magnetic nanoparticles is highly dependent on the composition, size and surface properties as well as the degree of aggregation of the nanoparticles. Therefore, understanding the relationships between these intrinsic parameters and the relaxivities that contribute to MRI contrast can lead to establishing essential guidance that may direct the design of engineered magnetic nanoparticles for theranostics applications. On the other hand, new contrast mechanism and imaging strategy can be developed based on the novel properties of engineered magnetic nanoparticles. This review will focus on discussing the recent findings on some chemical and physical properties of engineered magnetic nanoparticles affecting the relaxivities as well as the impact on MRI contrast. Furthermore, MRI methods for imaging magnetic nanoparticles including several newly developed MRI approaches aiming at improving the detection and quantification of the engineered magnetic nanoparticles are described.</abstract><notes>Huang, Jing; Zhong, Xiaodong; Wang, Liya; Yang, Lily; Mao, Hui; Australia; Theranostics. 2012;2(1):86-102.

MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: The patient-specific vascular geometry is reconstructed from computed tomography angiography images. The isogeometric analysis framework integrated with a special boundary condition for the firm wall adhesion of nanoparticles is implemented. A parallel plate flow chamber system is used to validate the computational model in vitro. RESULTS: Particle adhesion is dramatically affected by changes in patient-specific attributes, such as branching angle and receptor density. The adhesion pattern correlates well with the spatial and temporal distribution of the wall shear rates. For the case considered, the larger (2.0 microm) particles adhere two-times more in the lower branches of the arterial tree, whereas the smaller (0.5 microm) particles deposit more in the upper branches. CONCLUSION: Our computational framework in conjunction with patient-specific attributes can be used to rationally select nanoparticle properties to personalize, and thus optimize, therapeutic interventions.</abstract><notes>U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;England</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23199308 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1309</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1309</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoopes, P.

When activated by an alternating magnetic field (AMF), intra-tumoral IONPs have been effective at controlling tumor growth in rodent models. To accurately plan and assess IONP-based therapies in clinical patients, noninvasive and quantitative imaging technique for the assessment of IONP uptake and biodistribution will be necessary. Proven techniques such as confocal, light and electron microscopy, histochemical iron staining, ICP-MS, fluorescent labeled mNPs and magnetic spectroscopy of Brownian motion (MSB), are being used to assess and quantify IONPs in vitro and in ex vivo tissues. However, a proven noninvasive in vivo IONP imaging technique has not yet been developed. In this study we have demonstrated the shortcomings of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for effectively observing and quantifying iron /IONP concentrations in the clinical setting. Despite the poor outcomes of CT and standard MR sequences in the therapeutic concentration range, ultra-short T2 MRI methods such as, Sweep Imaging With Fourier Transformation (SWIFT), provide a positive iron contrast enhancement and a reduced signal to noise ratio. Ongoing software development and phantom and in vivo studies, will further optimize this technique, providing accurate, clinically-relevant IONP biodistribution information.</abstract><notes>10.1117/12.916097</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.916097</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.916097</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1433</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1433</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hood, L.</author><author>Tian, Q.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA 98109-5234, USA.

In the foreseeable future, clinicians, medical researchers, and ultimately the consumers and patients will be increasingly equipped with a deluge of personal health information, e.g., whole genome sequences, molecular profiling of diseased tissues, and periodic multi-analyte blood testing of biomarker panels for disease and wellness. The convergence of these practices will enable accurate prediction of disease susceptibility and early diagnosis for actionable preventive schema and personalized treatment regimes tailored to each individual. It will also entail proactive participation from all major stakeholders in the health care system.

Systems biology - holistic, global and integrative in approach - has given rise to systems medicine, a systems approach to health and disease. Systems medicine promises to (1) provide deep insights into disease mechanisms, (2) make blood a diagnostic window for viewing health and disease for the individual, (3) stratify complex diseases into their distinct subtypes for a impedance match against proper drugs, (4) provide new approaches to drug target discovery and (5) generate metrics for assessing wellness. P4 medicine, the clinical face of systems medicine, has two major objectives: to quantify wellness and to demystify disease. Patients and consumers will be a major driver in the realization of P4 medicine through their participation in medically oriented social networks directed at improving their own healthcare. P4 medicine has striking implications for society - including the ability to turn around the ever-escalating costs of healthcare. The challenge in bringing P4 medicine to patients and consumers is twofold: first, inventing the strategies and technologies that will enable P4 medicine and second, dealing with the impact of P4 medicine on society - including key ethical, social, legal, regulatory, and economic issues. Managing the societal problems will pose the most significant challenges. Strategic partnerships of a variety of types will be necessary to bring P4 medicine to patients.</abstract><notes>Hood, Leroy&#xD;Flores, Mauricio&#xD;GM076547/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;Netherlands&#xD;N Biotechnol. 2012 Sep 15;29(6):613-24. doi: 10.1016/j.nbt.2012.03.004.

An individual cell&apos;s fate is strongly influenced by its interactions with neighbouring cells. While this interaction has been recognized as critical in determining cell behaviour, its complexity and heterogeneity has thus far defied characterization by currently available techniques. Herein, we present a single-cell level co-culture platform for studies of dynamic cellular interactions, which is capable of maintaining and tracking single-cell pair interactions to simplify the complexity of intercellular communication. In this platform, heterotypic pairing on a single-cell level is achieved through sequential cell trapping and dynamic variation of fluidic resistance. Individual culture chambers provide trapped cells enough space to migrate and proliferate through multiple generations. Furthermore, the semi-isolated chambers, combined with continuously refreshed medium supplement, allow a stable communication environment around the cells. To demonstrate the platform capability, we cultured and tracked stem cell-fibroblast pairs for several generations. The subsequent effects of cell-cell interactions were then easily observed, due to the addressability of each isolated chamber, and quantitatively characterized. Specifically, we found that paired cells&apos; migration patterns were dependent on their initial distance from each other, and that heterotypic pairing led to distinct proliferation patterns from homotypic, single-cell culture. This study demonstrates the platform utility in providing a detailed and quantitative understanding of the complexity of cellular communication and its effects on cell behaviour in a variety of biological systems.</abstract><notes>Hong, Soongweon&#xD;Pan, Qiong&#xD;Lee, Luke P&#xD;26697290-47281-A/PHS HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Integr Biol (Camb). 2012 Apr;4(4):374-80. doi: 10.1039/c2ib00166g.

Two complementary strategies, utilizing either electrostatic or steric stabilization, have been developed to enhance the stability of graphene oxide in electrolyte solutions, allowing it to stay dispersed in cell culture media and serum. The electrostatic stabilization approach entails further oxidation of graphene oxide to low C/O ratio (~1.1) and increases ionic tolerance of these nanosheets. The steric stabilization technique employs an amphiphilic block copolymer that serves as a noncovalently bound surfactant to minimize the aggregate-inducing nanosheet-nanosheet interactions. Both strategies can stabilize graphene oxide nanosheets with large dimensions (&gt;300 nm) in biological media, allowing for an enhancement of &gt;250% in the bioconjugation efficiency of streptavidin in comparison to untreated nanosheets. Notably, both strategies allow the stabilized nanosheets to be readily taken up by cells, demonstrating their excellent performance as potential drug-delivery vehicles.</abstract><notes>Hong, Bong Jin; Compton, Owen C; An, Zhi; Eryazici, Ibrahim; Nguyen, SonBinh T; C54CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P30CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2012 Jan 24;6(1):63-73.

The kinetics and thermodynamics of the binding mechanism of Co(acacen)(NH(3))(2)Cl [Co(acacen); where H(2)acacen is bis(acetylacetone)ethylenediimine] enzyme inhibition has been examined through the inactivation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) protease activity. Co(acacen) is an irreversible inhibitor that exhibits time- and concentration-dependent inactivation of MMP-2. Co(acacen) inhibition of MMP-2 is temperature-dependent, with the inactivation increasing with temperature. Examination of the formation of the transition state for the MMP-2/Co(acacen) complex was determined to have a positive entropy component indicative of greater disorder in the MMP-2/Co(acacen) complex than in the reactants. With further insight into the mechanism of Co(acacen) complexes, Co(III) Schiff base complex protein inactivators can be designed to include features regulating activity and protein specificity. This approach is widely applicable to protein targets that have been identified to have clinical significance, including matrix metalloproteinases. The mechanistic information elucidated here further emphasizes the versatility and utility of Co(III) Schiff base complexes as customizable protein inhibitors.</abstract><notes>Harney, Allison S&#xD;Sole, Laura B&#xD;Meade, Thomas J&#xD;U54 CA119341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA119341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Germany&#xD;J Biol Inorg Chem. 2012 Aug;17(6):853-60.

Snail factors are required for the formation of neural crest stem cells in most vertebrate embryos, as well as for the migratory invasive behavior of these cells. Snail factors have recently been linked to the formation of cancer stem cells, and expression of Snail proteins may be associated with tumor recurrence and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We report that Co(III)-Ebox is a potent inhibitor of Snail-mediated transcriptional repression in breast cancer cells and in the neural crest of Xenopus. We further show that the activity of Co(III)-Ebox can be modulated by temperature, increasing the utility of this conjugate as a Snail inhibitor in model organisms. We exploit this feature to further delineate the requirements for Snail function during neural crest development, showing that in addition to the roles that Snail factors play in neural crest precursor formation and neural crest EMT/migration, inhibition of Snail function after the onset of neural crest migration leads to a loss of neural crest derived melanocytes. Co(III)-Ebox-mediated inhibition therefore provides a powerful tool for analysing the function of these core EMT factors with unparalleled temporal resolution. Moreover, the potency of Co(III)-Ebox as a Snail inhibitor in breast cancer cells suggests its potential as a therapeutic inhibitor of tumor progression and metastasis.</abstract><notes>Harney, Allison S; Meade, Thomas J; LaBonne, Carole; R01CA114058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e32318.

The field of RNA nanotechnology is emerging. However, controlled assembly of stable RNA nanoparticles with multiple functionalities which retain their original role is challenging due to refolding after fusion. Herein, we report the construction of thermodynamically stable X-shaped RNA nanoparticles to carry four therapeutic RNA motifs by self-assembly of reengineered small RNA fragments. We proved that each arm of the four helices in the X-motif can harbor one siRNA, ribozyme, or aptamer without affecting the folding of the central pRNA-X core, and each daughter RNA molecule within the nanoparticle folds into their respective authentic structures and retains their biological and structural function independently. Gene silencing effects were progressively enhanced as the number of the siRNA in each pRNA-X nanoparticles gradually increased from one to two, three, and four. More importantly, systemic injection of ligand-containing nanoparticles into the tail-vein of mice revealed that the RNA nanoparticles remained intact and strongly bound to cancers without entering the liver, lung or any other organs or tissues, while remaining in cancer tissue for more than 8 h.</abstract><notes>Haque, Farzin&#xD;Shu, Dan&#xD;Shu, Yi&#xD;Shlyakhtenko, Luda S&#xD;Rychahou, Piotr G&#xD;Evers, B Mark&#xD;Guo, Peixuan&#xD;R01 EB003730/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;U01 CA151648/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Nano Today. 2012 Aug;7(4):245-257.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23024702</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3458310</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.nantod.2012.06.010</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1157</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1157</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, Y.</author><author>He, Z.</author><author>Schulz, A.</author><author>Bronich, T.

A drug based on a nucleic acid, however, must be delivered to the interior of the target cell while surviving an array of biological defenses honed by evolution. Successful gene therapy is thus dependent on the development of an efficient delivery vector. Researchers have pursued two major vehicles for gene delivery: viral and nonviral (synthetic) vectors. Although viral vectors currently offer greater efficiency, nonviral vectors, which are typically based on cationic lipids or polymers, are preferred because of safety concerns with viral vectors. So far, nonviral vectors can readily transfect cells in culture, but efficient nanomedicines remain far removed from the clinic. Overcoming the obstacles associated with nonviral vectors to improve the delivery efficiency and therapeutic effect of nucleic acids is thus an active area of current research. The difficulties are manifold, including the strong interaction of cationic delivery vehicles with blood components, uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), toxicity, and managing the targeting ability of the carriers with respect to the cells of interest. Modifying the surface with poly(ethylene glycol), that is, PEGylation, is the predominant method used to reduce the binding of plasma proteins to nonviral vectors and minimize clearance by the RES after intravenous administration. Nanoparticles that are not rapidly cleared from the circulation accumulate in the tumors because of the enhanced permeability and retention effect, and the targeting ligands attached to the distal end of the PEGylated components allow binding to the receptors on the target cell surface. Neutral and anionic liposomes have been also developed for systemic delivery of nucleic acids in experimental animal models. Other approaches include (i) designing and synthesizing novel cationic lipids and polymers, (ii) chemically coupling the nucleic acid to peptides, targeting ligands, polymers, or environmentally sensitive moieties, and (iii) utilizing inorganic nanoparticles in nucleic acid delivery. Recently, the different classes of nonviral vectors appear to be converging, and the ability to combine features of different classes of nonviral vectors in a single strategy has emerged. With the strengths of several approaches working in concert, more hurdles associated with efficient nucleic acid delivery might therefore be overcome. In this Account, we focus on these novel nonviral vectors, which are classified as multifunctional hybrid nucleic acid vectors, novel membrane/core nanoparticles for nucleic acid delivery, and ultrasound-responsive nucleic acid vectors. We highlight systemic delivery studies and consider the future prospects for nucleic acid delivery. A better understanding of the fate of the nanoparticles inside the cell and of the interactions between the parts of hybrid particles should lead to a delivery system suitable for clinical use. We also underscore the value of sustained release of a nucleic acid in this endeavor; making vectors targeted to cells with sustained release in vivo should provide an interesting research challenge.</abstract><notes>Guo, Xia&#xD;Huang, Leaf&#xD;CA129421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA129835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA149363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA129421-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA129835-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA149363-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151652-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Acc Chem Res. 2012 Jul 17;45(7):971-9. doi: 10.1021/ar200151m.

A large variety of single stranded loops are suitable for inter- and intramolecular interactions, serving as mounting dovetails in self-assembly without the need for external linking dowels. Novel properties of RNA nanoparticles have been explored for treatment and detection of diseases and various other realms. The higher thermodynamic stability, holding of noncanonical base pairing, stronger folding due to base stacking properties, and distinctive in vivo attributes make RNA unique in comparison to DNA. Indeed, the potential application of RNA nanotechnology in therapeutics is an exciting area of research. The use of RNAi in biomedical research has opened up new possibilities to silence or regulate the biological function of individual genes. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been extensively explored to genetically manipulate the expression in vitro and in vivo of particular genes identified to play a key role in cancerous or viral diseases. However, the efficient silencing of the desired gene depends upon efficient delivery of siRNA to targeted cells, as well as in vivo stability. In this chapter, we use the bacteriophage phi29 motor pRNA-derived nanocarrier as a polyvalent targeted delivery system, introduce the potential of RNA-based therapeutics using nanobiotechnology or nanotechnology methods with the fabrication and modification of pRNA nanoparticles, and highlight its potential to become a valuable research tool and viable clinical approach for gene therapy.</abstract><notes>Guo, Peixuan&#xD;Shu, Yi&#xD;Binzel, Daniel&#xD;Cinier, Mathieu&#xD;CA151648/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;EB003730/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;GM059944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;Clifton, N.J.&#xD;Methods Mol Biol. 2012;928:197-219. doi: 10.1007/978-1-62703-008-3_16.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22956144</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-1-62703-008-3_16</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1155</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1155</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guo, P.</author><author>Haque, F.</author><author>Hallahan, B.</author><author>Reif, R.</author><author>Li, H.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Nanobiotechnology Center, Markey Cancer Center and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536, USA. guop@purdue.edu</auth-address><titles><title>Uniqueness, advantages, challenges, solutions, and perspectives in therapeutics applying RNA nanotechnology</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acid Ther</secondary-title><alt-title>Nucleic acid therapeutics</alt-title></titles><pages>226-45</pages><volume>22</volume><number>4</number><edition>2012/08/24</edition><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>Aug</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2159-3345 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>22913595</accession-num><abstract>The field of RNA nanotechnology is rapidly emerging. RNA can be manipulated with the simplicity characteristic of DNA to produce nanoparticles with a diversity of quaternary structures by self-assembly. Additionally RNA is tremendously versatile in its function and some RNA molecules display catalytic activities much like proteins. Thus, RNA has the advantage of both worlds. However, the instability of RNA has made many scientists flinch away from RNA nanotechnology. Other concerns that have deterred the progress of RNA therapeutics include the induction of interferons, stimulation of cytokines, and activation of other immune systems, as well as short pharmacokinetic profiles in vivo. This review will provide some solutions and perspectives on the chemical and thermodynamic stability, in vivo half-life and biodistribution, yield and production cost, in vivo toxicity and side effect, specific delivery and targeting, as well as endosomal trapping and escape.</abstract><notes>Guo, Peixuan&#xD;Haque, Farzin&#xD;Hallahan, Brent&#xD;Reif, Randall&#xD;Li, Hui&#xD;PN2 EY 018230/EY/NEI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB003730/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB012135/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 GM059944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;U01 CA151648/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Nucleic Acid Ther. 2012 Aug;22(4):226-45. doi: 10.1089/nat.2012.0350.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22913595</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3426230</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/nat.2012.0350</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1270</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1270</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Greytak, A.

This paper describes the development of a nanoparticle-based multiplexed platform that has the potential for simultaneous read-out of large numbers of biomolecules. For this purpose, we have chosen pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) as a test bed for diagnosis and prognosis. PA is a devastating form of cancer in which an estimated 86% of diagnoses resulted in death in the United States in 2010. The high mortality rate is due, in part, to the asymptomatic development of the disease and the dearth of sensitive diagnostics available for early detection. One promising route lies in the development of a serum biomarker panel that can generate a signature unique to early stage PA. We describe the design and development of a proof-of-concept PA biomarker immunoassay array coupled with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a sensitive readout method.</abstract><notes>Granger, Jennifer H&#xD;Granger, Michael C&#xD;Firpo, Matthew A&#xD;Mulvihill, Sean J&#xD;Porter, Marc D&#xD;Analyst. 2012 Nov 14.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23150876</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/c2an36128k</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>690</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">690</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goldberg, S.

Pyruvate kinase (PK) exists in M1 (PKM1) and M2 (PKM2) isoforms. PKM2, whose expression in cancer cells results in aerobic glycolysis and is suggested to bestow a selective growth advantage, is a promising target. Because many oncogenes impart a common alteration in cell metabolism, inhibition of the M2 isoform might be of broad applicability. We show that several small interfering (si) RNAs designed to target mismatches between the M2 and M1 isoforms confer specific knockdown of the former, resulting in decreased viability and increased apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines but less so in normal fibroblasts or endothelial cells. In vivo delivery of siPKM2 additionally causes substantial tumor regression of established xenografts. Our results suggest that the inherent nucleotide-level specificity of siRNA can be harnessed to develop therapeutics that target isoform-specific exons in genes exhibiting differential splicing patterns in various cell types.</abstract><notes>Goldberg, Michael S; Sharp, Phillip A; P30-CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Exp Med. 2012 Feb 13;209(2):217-24.

Therefore, we developed AID, an adaptive-iterative design for eco-toxicologist to more accurately and efficiently examine complex multiple stressor interactions. AID incorporates the power of the general linear model and A-optimal criteria with an iterative process that: 1) minimizes the required amount of a priori knowledge, 2) simplifies the experimental design, and 3) quantifies both individual and interactive effects. Once a stable model is determined, the best fit model is identified and the direction and magnitude of stressors, individually and all combinations (including complex interactions) are quantified. To validate AID, we selected five commonly co-occurring components of polluted aquatic systems, three metal stressors (Cd, Zn, As) and two water chemistry parameters (pH, hardness) to be tested using standard acute toxicity tests in which Daphnia mortality is the (nonlinear) response variable. We found after the initial data input of experimental data, although literature values (e.g. EC-values) may also be used, and after only two iterations of AID, our dose response model was stable. The model ln(Cd)*ln(Zn) was determined the best predictor of Daphnia mortality response to the combined effects of Cd, Zn, As, pH, and hardness. This model was then used to accurately identify and quantify the strength of both greater- (e.g. As*Cd) and less-than additive interactions (e.g. Cd*Zn). Interestingly, our study found only binary interactions significant, not higher order interactions. We conclude that AID is more efficient and effective at assessing multiple stressor interactions than current methods. Other applications, including life-history endpoints commonly used by regulators, could benefit from AID&apos;s efficiency in assessing water quality criteria.</abstract><notes>Glaholt, Stephen P&#xD;Chen, Celia Y&#xD;Demidenko, Eugene&#xD;Bugge, Deenie M&#xD;Folt, Carol L&#xD;Shaw, Joseph R&#xD;CA130880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P42ES007373/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA130880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01ES019324/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Netherlands&#xD;Sci Total Environ. 2012 Aug 15;432:57-64.

Effective nanoparticle cancer therapy requires significant accumulations of nanoparticles within the tumor environment. Various techniques have been used to improve tumor nanoparticle uptake and biodistribution. Most notable of these techniques is the use of tumor-specific peptide-conjugated nanoparticles and chemical modification of the nanoparticles with immune-evading polymers. Another strategy for improving the tumor uptake of the nanoparticles is modification of the tumor microenvironment with a goal of intensifying the enhanced permeability and retention effect inherent to solid tumors. We demonstrate a twofold increase in the tumor accumulation of systemically delivered iron oxide nanoparticles following a single 15-Gy radiation dose in a syngeneic mouse breast tumor model. This increase in nanoparticle tumor accumulation correlates with a radiation-induced decrease in tumor interstitial pressure and a subsequent increase in vascular permeability.</abstract><notes>Giustini, Andrew J&#xD;Petryk, Alicia A&#xD;Hoopes, P Jack&#xD;1U54CA151662-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Nanomedicine. 2012 Aug;8(6):818-21.

The potential efficacy and timing of a given magnetic nanoparticle treatment or diagnostic test is largely determined by the number of nanoparticles in each tissue and microscopic compartment: e.g., in the intravascular and extravascular spaces, in the interstitial space, cell surface and in cell cytoplasm. Techniques for monitoring these cell-level interactions generally require the harvesting and destruction of tissues or cells at each time point of interest. We present a method (magnetic spectroscopy of Brownian motion, MSB) for longitudinally monitoring nanoparticle binding to cell surface proteins and uptake by cancer cells in vitro using the harmonics of the magnetization produced by the nanoparticles. These harmonics can be measured rapidly and noninvasively without the need for nanoparticle modifications and without damaging the cells. We demonstrate sensitivity of this harmonic signal to the nanoparticles&apos; microenvironment and use this technique to monitor the nanoparticle binding activities of different cell lines.</abstract><notes>Giustini, Andrew J&#xD;Perreard, Irina&#xD;Rauwerdink, Adam M&#xD;Hoopes, P Jack&#xD;Weaver, John B&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Integr Biol (Camb). 2012 Sep 24;4(10):1283-8.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22945022</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3488289</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/c2ib20130e</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1265</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1265</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giam, L.

Owing to their intrinsic optical, electrical and magnetic properties, nanoparticles are promising contrast agents for imaging dynamic molecular and cellular processes such as protein-protein interactions, enzyme activity or gene expression. Until now, nanoparticles have been engineered with targeting ligands such as antibodies and peptides to improve tumour specificity and uptake. However, excessive loading of ligands can reduce the targeting capabilities of the ligand and reduce the ability of the nanoparticle to bind to a finite number of receptors on cells. Increasing the number of nanoparticles delivered to cells by each targeting molecule would lead to higher signal-to-noise ratios and would improve image contrast. Here, we show that M13 filamentous bacteriophage can be used as a scaffold to display targeting ligands and multiple nanoparticles for magnetic resonance imaging of cancer cells and tumours in mice. Monodisperse iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles assemble along the M13 coat, and its distal end is engineered to display a peptide that targets SPARC glycoprotein, which is overexpressed in various cancers. Compared with nanoparticles that are directly functionalized with targeting peptides, our approach improves contrast because each SPARC-targeting molecule delivers a large number of nanoparticles into the cells. Moreover, the targeting ligand and nanoparticles could be easily exchanged for others, making this platform attractive for in vivo high-throughput screening and molecular detection.</abstract><notes>Ghosh, Debadyuti&#xD;Lee, Youjin&#xD;Thomas, Stephanie&#xD;Kohli, Aditya G&#xD;Yun, Dong Soo&#xD;Belcher, Angela M&#xD;Kelly, Kimberly A&#xD;England&#xD;Nat Nanotechnol. 2012 Sep 16;7(10):677-82. doi: 10.1038/nnano.2012.146.

Most current technologies use EpCAM expression as a CTC identifier. However, given that a significant fraction of cancer patients have low or even absent EpCAM levels, there is a need for better detection methods. Here, we hypothesize that a multimarker strategy combined with direct sensing of CTC in whole blood would increase the detection of CTC in patients. Accordingly, molecular profiling of biopsies from a patient cohort revealed a four-marker set (EpCAM, HER-2, EGFR, and MUC-1) capable of effectively differentiating cancer cells from normal host cells. Using a point-of-care micro-nuclear magnetic resonance (microNMR) system, we consequently show that this multimarker combination readily detects individual CTC directly in whole blood without the need for primary purification. We also confirm these results in a comparative trial of patients with ovarian cancer. This platform could potentially benefit a broad range of applications in clinical oncology.</abstract><notes>Ghazani, Arezou A&#xD;Castro, Cesar M&#xD;Gorbatov, Rostic&#xD;Lee, Hakho&#xD;Weissleder, Ralph&#xD;54CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;K12CA087723-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50CA86355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01EB004626/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01EB010011/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;UO1EB012493/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;Canada&#xD;New York, N.Y.&#xD;Neoplasia. 2012 May;14(5):388-95.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22745585</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3384426</custom2><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1256</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1256</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ganta, S.</author><author>Singh, A.</author><author>Coleman, T.P.</author><author>Williams, D.</author><author>Amiji, M.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Ge, Y.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Pharmaceutical nanotechnology: overcoming drug delivery challenges in contemporary medicine</title><secondary-title>Nanomedicine principles and perspectives</secondary-title></titles><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>New York, NY</pub-location><publisher>Springer Publishing;</publisher><urls></urls></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1096</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1096</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gansen, A.</author><author>Herrick, A.

Digital DNA amplification has become an attractive technique to quantify absolute concentrations of DNA in a sample. While digital polymerase chain reaction is still the most widespread implementation, its use in resource-limited settings is impeded by the need for thermal cycling and robust temperature control. In such situations, isothermal protocols that can amplify DNA or RNA without thermal cycling are of great interest. Here, we accomplished the successful amplification of single DNA molecules in a stationary droplet array using isothermal digital loop-mediated DNA amplification. Unlike most (if not all) existing methods for sample discretization, our design allows for automated, loss-less digitization of sample volumes on-chip. We demonstrated accurate quantification of relative and absolute DNA concentrations with sample volumes of less than 2 mul. We assessed the homogeneity of droplet size during sample self-digitization in our device, and verified that the size variation was small enough such that straightforward counting of LAMP-active droplets sufficed for data analysis. We anticipate that the simplicity and robustness of our SD chip make it attractive as an inexpensive and easy-to-operate device for DNA amplification, for example in point-of-care settings.</abstract><notes>Gansen, Alexander&#xD;Herrick, Alison M&#xD;Dimov, Ivan K&#xD;Lee, Luke P&#xD;Chiu, Daniel T&#xD;R21 GM103459/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 GM103459-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 RR032399/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/&#xD;R21RR032399/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Lab Chip. 2012 Jun 21;12(12):2247-54.

Novel imaging contrast agents and targeting approaches are greatly needed to improve the sensitivity and specificity of cancer theranostic agents. Here, we implemented a novel approach using a magnetic micromesh and biocompatible fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles (FMN) to magnetically enhance cancer targeting in living subjects. This approach enables magnetic targeting of systemically administered individual FMN, containing a single 8 nm superparamagnetic iron oxide core. Using a human glioblastoma mouse model, we show that nanoparticles can be magnetically retained in both the tumor neovasculature and surrounding tumor tissues. Magnetic accumulation of nanoparticles within the neovasculature was observable by fluorescence intravital microscopy in real time. Finally, we demonstrate that such magnetically enhanced cancer targeting augments the biological functions of molecules linked to the nanoparticle surface.</abstract><notes>Fu, Aihua&#xD;Wilson, Robert J&#xD;Smith, Bryan R&#xD;Mullenix, Joyce&#xD;Earhart, Chris&#xD;Akin, Demir&#xD;Guccione, Samira&#xD;Wang, Shan X&#xD;Gambhir, Sanjiv S&#xD;1K99EB008558-01/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;1U54 CA119367-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;ACS Nano. 2012 Aug 28;6(8):6862-9. doi: 10.1021/nn301670a.

Despite extensive surgery and adjuvant aggressive high-dose systemic chemotherapy with potentially severe bystander side effects, cure is attainable in about 70% of patients with localized disease and only 20%-30% of those patients with metastatic disease. Targeted therapies clearly are warranted in improving our treatment of this adolescent killer. However, a lack of osteosarcoma-associated/specific markers has hindered development of targeted therapeutics. We describe a novel osteosarcoma-associated cell surface antigen, ALCAM. We, then, create an engineered anti-ALCAM-hybrid polymerized liposomal nanoparticle immunoconjugate (alpha-AL-HPLN) to specifically target osteosarcoma cells and deliver a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin. We have demonstrated that alpha-AL-HPLNs have significantly enhanced cytotoxicity over untargeted HPLNs and over a conventional liposomal doxorubicin formulation. In this way, alpha-AL-HPLNs are a promising new strategy to specifically deliver cytotoxic agents in osteosarcoma.</abstract><notes>Federman, Noah&#xD;Chan, Jason&#xD;Nagy, Jon O&#xD;Landaw, Elliot M&#xD;McCabe, Katelyn&#xD;Wu, Anna M&#xD;Triche, Timothy&#xD;Kang, Hyunggyoo&#xD;Liu, Bin&#xD;Marks, James D&#xD;Denny, Christopher T&#xD;Egypt&#xD;Sarcoma. 2012;2012:126906.

Early detection and treatment of invasive melanoma are therefore crucial to increase survival rates. Low molecular weight proteins and peptides have garnered significant interest as biomarker candidates as they potentially represent a snap shot of pathological condition within the body and, by extension, the organism as a whole. We have developed a nanoporous silica-based platform to segregate the low molecular weight from the high molecular weight protein fraction to aid in the detection of peptides from serum samples using mass spectrometry. The combination of sample treatment with our platform, MALDI-TOF MS and following biostatistical analysis led to the discovery and identification of 27 peptides that are potential biomarkers associated with the development of pulmonary metastatic melanoma. We strongly believe our findings can assist to discover stage-specific peptide signatures and lead to more specific and personalized treatments for patients suffering from pulmonary metastatic melanoma.</abstract><notes>R21 CA122864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R33 CA122864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Ireland</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23200677 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1106</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1106</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fan, J.</author><author>Gallagher, J.

Current proteomic-based approaches, such as two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and shotgun proteomics methods are labor-intensive, low throughput and offer limited suitability for clinical applications.(7-9) Therefore, a more effective strategy is needed to isolate LMWP from blood and allow the high throughput screening of clinical samples. Here, we present a fast, efficient and reliable multi-fractionation system based on mesoporous silica chips to specifically target and enrich LMWP.(10,11) Mesoporous silica (MPS) thin films with tunable features at the nanoscale were fabricated using the triblock copolymer template pathway. Using different polymer templates and polymer concentrations in the precursor solution, various pore size distributions, pore structures, connectivity and surface properties were determined and applied for selective recovery of low mass proteins. The selective parsing of the enriched peptides into different subclasses according to their physicochemical properties will enhance the efficiency of recovery and detection of low abundance species. In combination with mass spectrometry and statistic analysis, we demonstrated the correlation between the nanophase characteristics of the mesoporous silica thin films and the specificity and efficacy of low mass proteome harvesting. The results presented herein reveal the potential of the nanotechnology-based technology to provide a powerful alternative to conventional methods for LMWP harvesting from complex biological fluids. Because of the ability to tune the material properties, the capability for low-cost production, the simplicity and rapidity of sample collection, and the greatly reduced sample requirements for analysis, this novel nanotechnology will substantially impact the field of proteomic biomarker research and clinical proteomic assessment.</abstract><notes>Fan, Jia&#xD;Gallagher, James W&#xD;Wu, Hung-Jen&#xD;Landry, Matthew G&#xD;Sakamoto, Jason&#xD;Ferrari, Mauro&#xD;Hu, Ye&#xD;1U54CA151668-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;J Vis Exp. 2012 Apr 17;(62). pii: 3876. doi: 10.3791/3876.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Video-Audio Media</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22546927</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3466656</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.3791/3876</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1396</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1396</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fan, H.

However, this poses a risk to the fetus, so one must make a decision that weighs the desire for genetic information against the risk of an adverse outcome due to hazards of the testing process. These issues are not required to be coupled, and it would be desirable to discover genetic information about the fetus without incurring a health risk. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to non-invasively sequence the entire prenatal genome. Our results show that molecular counting of parental haplotypes in maternal plasma by shotgun sequencing of maternal plasma DNA allows the inherited fetal genome to be deciphered non-invasively. We also applied the counting principle directly to each allele in the fetal exome by performing exome capture on maternal plasma DNA before shotgun sequencing. This approach enables non-invasive exome screening of clinically relevant and deleterious alleles that were paternally inherited or had arisen as de novo germline mutations, and complements the haplotype counting approach to provide a comprehensive view of the fetal genome. Non-invasive determination of the fetal genome may ultimately facilitate the diagnosis of all inherited and de novo genetic disease.</abstract><notes>DP1 OD000251/OD/NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;England</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=22763444 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>851</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">851</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Epler, K.</author><author>Padilla D.</author><author>Phillips, G.</author><author>Crowder, P.</author><author>Castillo, R.</author><author>Wilkinson, D.</author><author>Wilkinson, B.</author><author>Burgard, C.</author><author>Kalinich, R.</author><author>Townson, J.</author><author>Chackerian, B.</author><author>Willman, C.</author><author>Peabody, D.</author><author>Wharton, W.</author><author>Brinker, C.

However, the body&apos;s natural defenses, including adhesive, rapidly cleared mucus linings coating nearly all entry points to the body not covered by skin, has limited the effectiveness of drug and gene delivery by nanoscale delivery systems. This article discusses the recent development of the &quot;mucuspenetrating particle&quot; or &quot;MPP&quot; nanotechnology, and how it has been used to both enhance understanding of the nanoscale barrier properties of human mucus secretions, and to achieve more uniform and longer-lasting drug delivery to mucosal tissues following topical administration. Drug loaded MPPs possess non-adhesive coatings that allow them to rapidly penetrate mucus layers through openings in the mucus mesh at rates nearly as fast as they would penetrate pure water. Critically, MPPs allow enhanced drug and gene delivery to mucosal tissues without diminishing the protective function of mucus. Recent progress in the development of MPPs as a biophysical tool to probe the length-scale dependent rheological properties of mucosal secretions and as a method for drug and gene delivery is highlighted.</abstract><notes>Ensign, Laura M&#xD;Schneider, Craig&#xD;Suk, Jung Soo&#xD;Cone, Richard&#xD;Hanes, Justin&#xD;P01HL51811/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01EB003558/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R21AI094519/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/&#xD;R33AI079740/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Howard Hughes Medical Institute/&#xD;Germany&#xD;Deerfield Beach, Fla.&#xD;Adv Mater. 2012 Jul 24;24(28):3887-94.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;Review</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22988559</url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1087</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1087</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dunn, S.

Self-assembled lipid- and polymer-based systems have been most extensively explored for transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) in liver and cancer therapies. Safety and compatibility of materials implemented in delivery systems must be ensured to maximize therapeutic indices. Hydrogel nanoparticles of defined dimensions and compositions, prepared via a particle molding process that is a unique off-shoot of soft lithography known as particle replication in nonwetting templates (PRINT), were explored in these studies as delivery vectors. Initially, siRNA was encapsulated in particles through electrostatic association and physical entrapment. Dose-dependent gene silencing was elicited by PEGylated hydrogels at low siRNA doses without cytotoxicity. To prevent disassociation of cargo from particles after systemic administration or during postfabrication processing for surface functionalization, a polymerizable siRNA pro-drug conjugate with a degradable, disulfide linkage was prepared. Triggered release of siRNA from the pro-drug hydrogels was observed under a reducing environment while cargo retention and integrity were maintained under physiological conditions. Gene silencing efficiency and cytocompatibility were optimized by screening the amine content of the particles. When appropriate control siRNA cargos were loaded into hydrogels, gene knockdown was only encountered for hydrogels containing releasable, target-specific siRNAs, accompanied by minimal cell death. Further investigation into shape, size, and surface decoration of siRNA-conjugated hydrogels should enable efficacious targeted in vivo RNAi therapies.</abstract><notes>Dunn, Stuart S&#xD;Tian, Shaomin&#xD;Blake, Steven&#xD;Wang, Jin&#xD;Galloway, Ashley L&#xD;Murphy, Andrew&#xD;Pohlhaus, Patrick D&#xD;Rolland, Jason P&#xD;Napier, Mary E&#xD;DeSimone, Joseph M&#xD;1DP1OD006432/OD/NIH HHS/&#xD;DP1 CA174425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB009565/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01EB009565/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54-CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54-CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;J Am Chem Soc. 2012 May 2;134(17):7423-30.

The goal of this study is to identify kinase based potential therapeutic target in osteosarcomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used a lentiviral-based shRNA kinase library to screen for kinases which play a role in osteosarcoma cell survival. The cell proliferation assay was used to evaluate cell growth and survival. siRNA assays were applied to confirm the observed phenotypic changes resulting from the loss of kinase gene expression. CDK11 (PITSLRE) was identified as essential for the survival of osteosarcoma cells, and its expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Overall patient survival was correlated with the CDK11 expression and its prognosis. The role of CDK11 expression in sustaining osteosarcoma growth was further evaluated in an osteosarcoma xenograft model in vivo. RESULTS: Osteosarcoma cells display high levels of CDK11 expression. CDK11 expression knocked down by either lentiviral shRNA or siRNA inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that patients with osteosarcoma with high CDK11 tumor expression levels were associated with significantly shorter survival than patients with osteosarcoma with low level of tumor CDK11 expression. Systemic in vivo administration of in vivo ready siRNA of CDK11 reduced the tumor growth in an osteosarcoma subcutaneous xenograft model.

Prior studies have identified (2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-quinolinyl)(2-piperidinyl)methanol (5) (NSC23925) to be a small molecule agent that reverses MDR in cancer cells. We synthesized all four isomers of 5 and analyzed them by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). Structure-activity relationships for reversing MDR were evaluated. Isomer 11 demonstrated the most potent activity. 11 reversed MDR in several drug-resistant cell lines expressing Pgp, including ovarian, breast, colon, uterine, and sarcoma cancer. 11 resensitized these cell lines to paclitaxel, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, vincristine, and trabectedin with no effect on cell sensitivity to cisplatin, topotecan, and methotrexate. 11 significantly enhanced in vivo antitumor activity of paclitaxel in MDR xenograft models, without increasing the level of paclitaxel toxicity. In conclusion, 11 and derivatives of this compound may hold therapeutic value in the treatment of MDR-dependent cancers.</abstract><notes>Duan, Zhenfeng; Li, Xin; Huang, Haoxi; Yuan, Wei; Zheng, Shao-Liang; Liu, Xianzhe; Zhang, Zhan; Choy, Edwin; Harmon, David; Mankin, Henry; Hornicek, Francis; U01 CA 151452/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Med Chem. 2012 Apr 12;55(7):3113-21.

Despite advances in prostate cancer screening, more than a quarter of a million men die from the disease every year(1) due primarily to treatment-resistance and metastasis. Colloidal nanotechnologies can provide tremendous enhancements to existing targeting/treatment strategies for prostate cancer to which malignant cells are less sensitive. Here, we show that antiandrogen gold nanoparticles--multivalent analogues of antiandrogens currently used in clinical therapy for prostate cancer--selectively engage two distinct receptors, androgen receptor (AR), a target for the treatment of prostate cancer, as well as a novel G-protein coupled receptor, GPRC6A, that is also upregulated in prostate cancer. These nanoparticles selectively accumulated in hormone-insensitive and chemotherapy-resistant prostate cancer cells, bound androgen receptor with multivalent affinity, and exhibited greatly enhanced drug potency versus monovalent antiandrogens currently in clinical use. Further, antiandrogen gold nanoparticles selectively stimulated GPRC6A with multivalent affinity, demonstrating that the delivery of nanoscale antiandrogens can also be facilitated by the transmembrane receptor in order to realize increasingly selective, increasingly potent therapy for treatment-resistant prostate cancers.</abstract><notes>Dreaden, Erik C&#xD;Gryder, Berkley E&#xD;Austin, Lauren A&#xD;Tene Defo, Brice A&#xD;Hayden, Steven C&#xD;Pi, Min&#xD;Quarles, L Darryl&#xD;Oyelere, Adegboyega K&#xD;El-Sayed, Mostafa A&#xD;1U01CA151802-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 AR037308/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA131217/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01-AR37308/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01CA131217/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U01 CA151802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Bioconjug Chem. 2012 Aug 15;23(8):1507-12. doi: 10.1021/bc300158k.

New methods for detection and treatment have dramatically improved cancer care in the United States. However, as improved detection and increasing exposure to carcinogens has led to higher rates of cancer incidence, clinicians and researchers have not balanced that increase with a similar decrease in cancer mortality rates. This mismatch highlights a clear and urgent need for increasingly potent and selective methods with which to detect and treat cancers at their earliest stages. Nanotechnology, the use of materials with structural features ranging from 1 to 100 nm in size, has dramatically altered the design, use, and delivery of cancer diagnostic and therapeutic agents. The unique and newly discovered properties of these structures can enhance the specificities with which biomedical agents are delivered, complementing their efficacy or diminishing unintended side effects. Gold (and silver) nanotechnologies afford a particularly unique set of physiological and optical properties which can be leveraged in applications ranging from in vitro/vivo therapeutics and drug delivery to imaging and diagnostics, surgical guidance, and treatment monitoring. Nanoscale diagnostic and therapeutic agents have been in use since the development of micellar nanocarriers and polymer-drug nanoconjugates in the mid-1950s, liposomes by Bangham and Watkins in the mid-1960s, and the introduction of polymeric nanoparticles by Langer and Folkman in 1976. Since then, nanoscale constructs such as dendrimers, protein nanoconjugates, and inorganic nanoparticles have been developed for the systemic delivery of agents to specific disease sites. Today, more than 20 FDA-approved diagnostic or therapeutic nanotechnologies are in clinical use with roughly 250 others in clinical development. The global market for nano-enabled medical technologies is expected to grow to $70-160 billion by 2015, rivaling the current market share of biologics worldwide. In this Account, we explore the emerging applications of noble metal nanotechnologies in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics carried out by our group and by others. Many of the novel biomedical properties associated with gold and silver nanoparticles arise from confinement effects: (i) the confinement of photons within the particle which can lead to dramatic electromagnetic scattering and absorption (useful in sensing and heating applications, respectively); (ii) the confinement of molecules around the nanoparticle (useful in drug delivery); and (iii) the cellular/subcellular confinement of particles within malignant cells (such as selective, nuclear-targeted cytotoxic DNA damage by gold nanoparticles). We then describe how these confinement effects relate to specific aspects of diagnosis and treatment such as (i) laser photothermal therapy, optical scattering microscopy, and spectroscopic detection, (ii) drug targeting and delivery, and (iii) the ability of these structures to act as intrinsic therapeutic agents which can selectively perturb/inhibit cellular functions such as division. We intend to provide the reader with a unique physical and chemical perspective on both the design and application of these technologies in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. We also suggest a framework for approaching future research in the field.</abstract><notes>Acc Chem Res. 2012 Apr 30.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22546051</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/ar2003122</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1161</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1161</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dreaden, E.

However, over the past two decades, their beautiful colors and unique electronic properties have also attracted tremendous attention due to their historical applications in art and ancient medicine and current applications in enhanced optoelectronics and photovoltaics. In spite of their modest alchemical beginnings, gold nanoparticles exhibit physical properties that are truly different from both small molecules and bulk materials, as well as from other nanoscale particles. Their unique combination of properties is just beginning to be fully realized in range of medical diagnostic and therapeutic applications. This critical review will provide insights into the design, synthesis, functionalization, and applications of these artificial molecules in biomedicine and discuss their tailored interactions with biological systems to achieve improved patient health. Further, we provide a survey of the rapidly expanding body of literature on this topic and argue that gold nanotechnology-enabled biomedicine is not simply an act of &apos;gilding the (nanomedicinal) lily&apos;, but that a new &apos;Golden Age&apos; of biomedical nanotechnology is truly upon us. Moving forward, the most challenging nanoscience ahead of us will be to find new chemical and physical methods of functionalizing gold nanoparticles with compounds that can promote efficient binding, clearance, and biocompatibility and to assess their safety to other biological systems and their long-term term effects on human health and reproduction (472 references).</abstract><notes>Dreaden, Erik C; Alkilany, Alaaldin M; Huang, Xiaohua; Murphy, Catherine J; El-Sayed, Mostafa A; 1U01CA151802-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Chem Soc Rev. 2012 Apr 7;41(7):2740-79.

As a result, these sensors have often been suggested as an attractive option for applications in point-of-care (POC) medical diagnostics. Unfortunately, a number of performance issues, such as gate leakage and current instability due to fluid contact, have prevented widespread adoption of the technology for routine use. High-k dielectrics, such as hafnium oxide (HfO(2)), have the known ability to address these challenges by passivating the exposed surfaces against destabilizing concerns of ion transport. With these fundamental stability issues addressed, a promising target for POC diagnostics and SiNWFETs has been small oligonucleotides, more specifically, microRNA (miRNA). MicroRNAs are small RNA oligonucleotides which bind to mRNAs, causing translational repression of proteins, gene silencing, and expressions are typically altered in several forms of cancer. In this paper, we describe a process for fabricating stable HfO(2) dielectric-based silicon nanowires for biosensing applications. Here we demonstrate sensing of single-stranded DNA analogues to their microRNA cousins using miR-10b and miR-21 as templates, both known to be upregulated in breast cancer. We characterize the effect of surface functionalization on device performance using the miR-10b DNA analogue as the target sequence and different molecular weight poly-l-lysine as the functionalization layer. By optimizing the surface functionalization and fabrication protocol, we were able to achieve &lt;100 fM detection levels of the miR-10b DNA analogue, with a theoretical limit of detection of 1 fM. Moreover, the noncomplementary DNA target strand, based on miR-21, showed very little response, indicating a highly sensitive and highly selective biosensing platform.</abstract><notes>Dorvel, Brian R&#xD;Reddy, Bobby Jr&#xD;Go, Jonghyun&#xD;Duarte Guevara, Carlos&#xD;Salm, Eric&#xD;Alam, Muhammad Ashraful&#xD;Bashir, Rashid&#xD;NIH R01-CA20003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;NIH-NCIR25 CA154015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA120003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R25 CA154015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;ACS Nano. 2012 Jul 24;6(7):6150-64. doi: 10.1021/nn301495k.

The organic solvents and reagents needed for these applications are often volatile, sensitive to contamination, and wetting, i.e. have contact angles of &lt;90 degrees even on the highly hydrophobic surfaces (e.g., Teflon(R) or Cytop(R)) typically used on digital microfluidic chips. Furthermore, often the applications dictate that the processes are performed in a gas environment, not allowing the use of a filler liquid (e.g., oil). These properties pose challenges for delivering controlled volumes of liquid to the chip. An automated, simple, accurate and reliable method of delivering reagents from sealed, off-chip reservoirs is presented here. This platform overcomes the issues of evaporative losses of volatile solvents, cross-contamination, and flooding of the chip by combining a syringe pump, a simple on-chip liquid detector and a robust interface design. The impedance-based liquid detection requires only minimal added hardware to provide a feedback signal to ensure accurate volumes of volatile solvents are introduced to the chip, independent of time delays between dispensing operations. On-demand dispensing of multiple droplets of acetonitrile, a frequently used but difficult to handle solvent due to its wetting properties and volatility, was demonstrated and used to synthesize the positron emission tomography (PET) probe [(18)F]FDG reliably.</abstract><notes>Ding, Huijiang&#xD;Sadeghi, Saman&#xD;Shah, Gaurav J&#xD;Chen, Supin&#xD;Keng, Pei Yuin&#xD;Kim, Chang-Jin C J&#xD;van Dam, R Michael&#xD;U54CA151819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Lab Chip. 2012 Sep 21;12(18):3331-40. doi: 10.1039/c2lc40244k.

It has often been suggested that the efficacy of cell therapies can greatly be improved through the ability to localize and regulate cellular activities at a transplantation site; however, the technologies for this control are lacking. Therefore, this study reports a cell-Laden hydrogel patch engineered to support the proliferation and angiogenic growth factor expression of cells adhered to their surfaces, and to further promote neovascularization. Hydrogels consisting of alginate chemically linked with pyrrole units, termed alginate-g-pyrrole, were prepared through an oxidative cross-linking reaction between pyrrole units. Fibroblasts adhered to the alginate-g-pyrrole hydrogels, and exhibited increased proliferation and overall vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, compared to those on pyrrole-free hydrogels. Furthermore, the alginate-g-pyrrole hydrogel surfaces were modified to present microposts, subsequently increasing the amount of pyrrole units on their surfaces. Cells adhered to the microfabricated gel surfaces exhibited increased proliferation and overall VEGF expression proportional to the density of the microposts. The resulting micropatterned alginate-g-pyrrole hydrogels exhibited increases in the size and density of mature blood vessels when implanted on chick chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs). The hydrogel system developed in this study will be broadly useful for improving the efficacy of a wide array of cell-based wound healing and tissue regenerative therapies.</abstract><notes>DeVolder, Ross J&#xD;Zill, Andrew T&#xD;Jeong, Jae H&#xD;Kong, Hyunjoon&#xD;1R25CA154015A/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Biomaterials. 2012 Nov;33(31):7718-26. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.07.001.

This study reports a simple but efficient strategy that tunes the mechanical properties of, and apatite formation in, collagen gels by incorporating hydrolyzable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles within the gels. The PLGA microparticles are associated with the collagen fibrils and increased both the gel&apos;s elasticity and rigidity while minimally influencing its permeability. As compared with pure collagen gels, the PLGA microparticle-filled collagen gels, termed PLGA-Col hydrogels, significantly enhanced the deposition of apatite-like minerals within the gels when incubated in simulated body fluid or encapsulated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) undergoing osteogenic differentiation. Finally, PLGA-Col hydrogels mineralized by differentiated MSCs led to an enhanced formation of bone-like tissues within the hydrogels. Overall, the PLGA-Col hydrogel system developed in this study will serve to improve the quality of osteoconductive matrices for both fundamental and clinical studies that are relevant to bone repair, regeneration, and pathogenesis.</abstract><notes>Tissue Eng Part A. 2012 Jun 26.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22480235</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0547</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>940</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">940</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Devolder, R.</author><author>Kong, H.

Hydrogels have emerged as invaluable platforms for examining the effects of extracellular matrix (ECM) properties on cell activities because of their several advantageous features. Specifically, hydrogels are unique materials that enable cell studies in three-dimensional (3D) environments, similar to in vivo environments. Recently, there have been increasing efforts to assemble cell-encapsulating hydrogels; however, hydrogel design strategies for 3D cell cultures have not been systematically discussed to date. Therefore, this review article summarizes current hydrogel designs for 3D cell culture studies and further discusses current challenges and potential resolutions for enhancing the controllability of hydrogel properties and microstructures. The hydrogels discussed herein include those of natural polymers (e.g., collagen, fibrinogen, alginate, and hyaluronic acids), synthetic polymers [e.g., poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and its derivatives], and mixtures of natural and synthetic polymers. We envision that hydrogels that enable 3D studies will greatly assist in the understanding of emergent cell behaviors, and ultimately become important biomedical tools for enhancing the quality of in vitro drug screening and clinical treatments.

An optimized version of the pointwise CI with the shortest width is developed. A new ellipse-envelope simultaneous CB for the ROC curve is suggested as an adaptation of the Working-Hotelling-type CB implemented in a paper by Ma and Hall (1993). Statistical simulations show that our ellipse-envelope CB covers the true ROC curve with a probability close to nominal while the coverage probability of the Ma and Hall CB is significantly smaller. Simulations also show that our CI for the area under the ROC curve is close to nominal while the coverage probability of the CI suggested by Hanley and McNail (1982) uniformly overestimates the nominal value. Two examples illustrate our simultaneous ROC bands: radiation dose estimation from time to vomiting and discrimination of breast cancer from benign abnormalities using electrical impedance measurements.</abstract><notes>R01 CA130880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;R01 CA130880-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal article</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=22523442 </url></related-urls></urls><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>476</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">476</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Della Rocca, J.</author><author>Liu, D.</author><author>Lin, W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Are high drug loading nanoparticles the next step forward for chemotherapy?</title><secondary-title>Nanomedicine (Lond)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nanomedicine (Lond)</full-title><abbr-1>Nanomedicine (London, England)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>303-5</pages><volume>7</volume><number>3</number><edition>2012/03/06</edition><keywords><keyword>CA151652</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>Mar</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1748-6963 (Electronic); 1743-5889 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>22385191</accession-num><notes>Della Rocca, Joseph; Liu, Demin; Lin, Wenbin; U01-CA151455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54-CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; London, England; Nanomedicine (Lond). 2012 Mar;7(3):303-5.</notes><work-type>Editorial; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22385191</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.2217/nnm.11.191</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1159</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1159</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dekrafft, K.

However, its extremely low natural occurrence has impeded clinical advancement. We developed a strategy directed at the design of simplified and synthetically more accessible bryostatin analogs. Our lead analog, &quot;picolog&quot;, can be step-economically produced. Picolog, compared to bryostatin, exhibited superior growth inhibition of MYC-induced lymphoma in vitro. A key mechanism of picolog&apos;s (and bryostatin&apos;s) activity is activation of PKC. A novel nano-immunoassay (NIA) revealed that picolog treatment increased phospho-MEK2 in the PKC pathway. Moreover, the inhibition of PKC abrogated picolog&apos;s activity. Finally, picolog was highly potent at 100 micrograms/kg and well tolerated at doses ranging from 100 micrograms/kg to 1 milligram/kg in vivo for the treatment of our aggressive model of MYC-induced lymphoma. We provide the first in vivo validation that the bryostatin analog, picolog, is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.</abstract><notes>DeChristopher, Brian A&#xD;Fan, Alice C&#xD;Felsher, Dean W&#xD;Wender, Paul A&#xD;CA 105102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA 112973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA 114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;K23 CA140722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P01 CA034233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA 089305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R37 CA031845-32/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R37 CA31845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Oncotarget. 2012 Jan;3(1):58-66.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22308267</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3292892</custom2><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1186</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1186</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de la Zerda, A.</author><author>Bodapati, S.</author><author>Teed, R.</author><author>May, S.

However, since many diseases will not manifest an endogenous photoacoustic contrast, it is essential to develop exogenous photoacoustic contrast agents that can target diseased tissue(s). Here we present a family of novel photoacoustic contrast agents that are based on the binding of small optical dyes to single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT-dye). We synthesized five different SWNT-dye contrast agents using different optical dyes, creating five &quot;flavors&quot; of SWNT-dye nanoparticles. In particular, SWNTs that were coated with either QSY(21) (SWNT-QSY) or indocyanine green (SWNT-ICG) exhibited over 100-times higher photoacoustic contrast in living animals compared to plain SWNTs, leading to subnanomolar sensitivities. We then conjugated the SWNT-dye conjugates with cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptides to molecularly target the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, which is associated with tumor angiogenesis. Intravenous administration of these tumor-targeted imaging agents to tumor-bearing mice showed significantly higher photoacoustic signal in the tumor than in mice injected with the untargeted contrast agent. Finally, we were able to spectrally separate the photoacoustic signals of SWNT-QSY and SWNT-ICG in living animals injected subcutaneously with both particles in the same location, opening the possibility for multiplexing in vivo studies.</abstract><notes>de la Zerda, Adam&#xD;Bodapati, Sunil&#xD;Teed, Robert&#xD;May, Salomon Y&#xD;Tabakman, Scott M&#xD;Liu, Zhuang&#xD;Khuri-Yakub, Butrus T&#xD;Chen, Xiaoyuan&#xD;Dai, Hongjie&#xD;Gambhir, Sanjiv S&#xD;P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;ACS Nano. 2012 Jun 26;6(6):4694-701. doi: 10.1021/nn204352r.

Therefore, many targeted therapies are in development. The transferrin receptor (TfR) functions in cellular iron uptake through its interaction with transferrin. This receptor is an attractive molecule for the targeted therapy of cancer since it is upregulated on the surface of many cancer types and is efficiently internalized. This receptor can be targeted in two ways: 1) for the delivery of therapeutic molecules into malignant cells or 2) to block the natural function of the receptor leading directly to cancer cell death. SCOPE OF REVIEW: In the present article we discuss the strategies used to target the TfR for the delivery of therapeutic agents into cancer cells. We provide a summary of the vast types of anti-cancer drugs that have been delivered into cancer cells employing a variety of receptor binding molecules including Tf, anti-TfR antibodies, or TfR-binding peptides alone or in combination with carrier molecules including nanoparticles and viruses. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Targeting the TfR has been shown to be effective in delivering many different therapeutic agents and causing cytotoxic effects in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The extensive use of TfR for targeted therapy attests to the versatility of targeting this receptor for therapeutic purposes against malignant cells. More advances in this area are expected to further improve the therapeutic potential of targeting the TfR for cancer therapy leading to an increase in the number of clinical trials of molecules targeting this receptor. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Transferrins: molecular mechanisms of iron transport and disorders.</abstract><notes>Daniels, Tracy R; Bernabeu, Ezequiel; Rodriguez, Jose A; Patel, Shabnum; Kozman, Maggie; Chiappetta, Diego A; Holler, Eggehard; Ljubimova, Julia Y; Helguera, Gustavo; Penichet, Manuel L; K01 CA138559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA136841-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Netherlands; Biochim Biophys Acta. 2012 Mar;1820(3):291-317.

Nanoconstructs composed of nucleolin-specific aptamers and gold nanostars were actively transported to the nucleus and induced major changes to the nuclear phenotype via nuclear envelope invaginations near the site of the construct. The number of local deformations could be increased by ultrafast, light-triggered release of the aptamers from the surface of the gold nanostars. Cancer cells with more nuclear envelope folding showed increased caspase 3 and 7 activity (apoptosis) as well as decreased cell viability.

The pharmacokinetics of two cylindrical shaped particles with diameter=80nm; height=320nm (PRINT-Doc-80x320) and d=200nm; h=200nm (PRINT-Doc-200x200) were compared to Docetaxel in mice bearing human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 flank xenografts. The Docetaxel plasma exposure was ~20-fold higher for both particles compared to docetaxel. Additionally, the volume of distribution (Vd) of Docetaxel in PRINT formulations was ~18-fold (PRINT-Doc-80x320) and ~33-fold (PRINT-Doc-200x200) lower than Docetaxel. The prolonged duration of Docetaxel in plasma when dosed with PRINT formulations subsequently led to increased tumor exposure of Docetaxel from 0 to 168h (~53% higher for PRINT-Doc-80x320 and ~76% higher for PRINT-Doc-200x200 particles). PRINT-Doc-80x320 had lower exposures in the liver, spleen and lung compared with PRINT-Doc-200x200. Thus, the use of particles with smaller feature size may be preferred to decrease clearance by organs of the mononuclear phagocyte system. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: In this study, the plasma, tumor, and tissue pharmacokinetics of different Docetaxel nanoparticles of precise shape and size were characterized in mice with human ovarian carcinoma xenograft. It is concluded that the use of particles with smaller feature size may be preferred to decrease clearance by organs of the mononuclear phagocyte system.</abstract><notes>U54 CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;United States&#xD;nanotechnology, biology, and medicine</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23219874 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1425</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1425</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cho, M.

Here we report a direct proliferative effect of platelets on cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Incubation of platelets with ovarian cancer cells from murine (ID8 and 2C6) or human (SKOV3 and OVCAR5) origin increased cell proliferation. The proliferative effect of platelets was not dependent on direct contact with cancer cells, and preincubation of platelets with blocking antibodies against platelet adhesion molecules did not alter their effect on cancer cells. The proliferative effect of platelets was reduced by fixing platelets with paraformaldehyde, preincubating platelets with a TGF-beta1-blocking antibody, or reducing expression of TGF-betaR1 receptor on cancer cells with siRNA. Infusing platelets into mice with orthotopic ovarian tumors significantly increased the proliferation indices in these tumors.

However, effective and efficient methods are needed to improve the diagnosis and assessment of cancer. Here, we report a single-step detection method using a nanoplasmonic aptamer sensor (aptasensor), targeting a vascular endothelial growth factor-165 (VEGF(165)), a predominant biomarker of cancer angiogenesis. Our single-step detection is accomplished by (1) specific target recognition by an aptamer-target molecule interaction and (2) direct readouts of the target recognition. The readout is achieved by inactivation of surface plasmon enhancement of fluorescent probes preattached to the aptamers. Our aptasensor provides the appropriate sensitivity for clinical diagnostics with a wide range of linear detection from 25 pg/mL to 25 mug/mL (=from 1.25 pM to 1.25 muM), high specificity for VEGF(165) against PDGF-BB, osteopontin (OPN), VEGF(121), NaCl, and temporal/thermal/biological stability. In experiments with 100% serum and saliva from clinical samples, readouts of the aptasensor and an ELISA for VEGF(165) show good agreement within the limit of the ELISA kit. We envision that our developed aptasensor holds utilities for point-of-care cancer prognostics by incorporating simplicity in detection, low-cost for test, and required small sample volumes.</abstract><notes>Cho, Hansang&#xD;Yeh, Erh-Chia&#xD;Sinha, Raghu&#xD;Laurence, Ted A&#xD;Bearinger, Jane P&#xD;Lee, Luke P&#xD;U54 CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;ACS Nano. 2012 Sep 25;6(9):7607-14.

Tumors with cell autonomous Hh activation (e.g., medulloblastomas) can acquire secondary mutations at the Smoothened (Smo) antagonist binding pocket, which render them refractory to conventional Hh inhibitors. A class of Hh pathway inhibitors (HPI) has been identified that block signaling downstream of Smo; one of these compounds, HPI-1, is a potent antagonist of the Hh transcription factor Gli1 and functions independent of upstream components in the pathway. Systemic administration of HPI-1 is challenging due to its minimal aqueous solubility and poor bioavailability. We engineered a polymeric nanoparticle from [poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid); (PLGA)] conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), encapsulating HPI-1 (NanoHHI). NanoHHI particles have an average diameter of approximately 60 nm, forms uniform aqueous suspension, and improved systemic bioavailability compared with the parent compound. In contrast to the prototype targeted Smo antagonist, HhAntag (Genentech), NanoHHI markedly inhibits the growth of allografts derived from Ptch(-/+); Trp53(-/-) mouse medulloblastomas that harbor a Smo(D477G) binding site mutation (P &lt; 0.001), which is accompanied by significant downregulation of mGli1 as well as bona fide Hh target genes (Akna, Cltb, and Olig2). Notably, NanoHHI combined with gemcitabine also significantly impedes the growth of orthotopic Pa03C pancreatic cancer xenografts that have a ligand-dependent, paracrine mechanism of Hh activation when compared with gemcitabine alone.

As top-down lithography reaches the length scale of a single macromolecule, the combination with the bottom-up synthesis of polymer brushes by surface-initiated polymerization becomes one main avenue to design new materials for nanotechnology. Recent developments in surface-initiated polymerizations are highlighted along with diverse strategies to create patterned polymer brushes on all length scales based on irradiation (photo- and interference lithography, electron-beam lithography), mechanical contact (scanning probe lithography, soft lithography, nanoimprinting lithography) and on surface forces (capillary force lithography, colloidal lithography, Langmuir-Blodgett lithography) (116 references).</abstract><notes>Chen, Tao; Amin, Ihsan; Jordan, Rainer; U01 CA151806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Chem Soc Rev. 2012 Apr 21;41(8):3280-96.

However, this technique also poses many biological and informatics challenges to extracting meaningful biological information. The RNA-seq data analysis is built on the foundation of high quality initial genome localization and alignment information for RNA-seq sequences. Toward this goal, we have developed RNASEQR to accurately and effectively map millions of RNA-seq sequences. We have systematically compared RNASEQR with four of the most widely used tools using a simulated data set created from the Consensus CDS project and two experimental RNA-seq data sets generated from a human glioblastoma patient. Our results showed that RNASEQR yields more accurate estimates for gene expression, complete gene structures and new transcript isoforms, as well as more accurate detection of single nucleotide variants (SNVs). RNASEQR analyzes raw data from RNA-seq experiments effectively and outputs results in a manner that is compatible with a wide variety of specialized downstream analyses on desktop computers.</abstract><notes>Chen, Leslie Y; Wei, Kuo-Chen; Huang, Abner C-Y; Wang, Kai; Huang, Chiung-Yin; Yi, Danielle; Tang, Chuan Yi; Galas, David J; Hood, Leroy E; England; Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Mar;40(6):e42.

However, there have been two main challenges for these vectors: (i) the existing synthetic approaches are cumbersome and incapable of achieving precise control of their structural properties, which will affect their biodistribution and therapeutic efficacies, and (ii) lack of an early checkpoint to quickly predict which drug(s)-incorporated vectors exhibit optimal therapeutic outcomes. In this work, we utilized a new rational developmental approach to rapidly screen nanoparticle (NP)-based cancer therapeutic agents containing a built-in companion diagnostic utility for optimal therapeutic efficacy. The approach leverages the advantages of a self-assembly synthetic method for preparation of two different sizes of drug-incorporated supramolecular nanoparticles (SNPs), and a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging-based biodistribution study to quickly evaluate the accumulation of SNPs at a tumor site in vivo and select the favorable SNPs for in vivo therapeutic study. Finally, the enhanced in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of the selected SNPs was validated by tumor reduction/inhibition studies. We foresee our rational developmental approach providing a general strategy in the search of optimal therapeutic agents among the diversity of NP-based therapeutic agents.</abstract><notes>Chen, Kuan-Ju&#xD;Tang, Li&#xD;Garcia, Mitch Andre&#xD;Wang, Hao&#xD;Lu, Hua&#xD;Lin, Wei-Yu&#xD;Hou, Shuang&#xD;Yin, Qian&#xD;Shen, Clifton K-F&#xD;Cheng, Jianjun&#xD;Tseng, Hsian-Rong&#xD;1R21CA152627/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 1R21EB008419/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 EB008419-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Biomaterials. 2012 Feb;33(4):1162-9.

These cells, which are refractory to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are thought to persist following treatment and drive tumor recurrence. We examined whether BCSCs are similarly resistant to hyperthermic therapy, and whether nanoparticles could be used to overcome this resistance. Using a model of triple-negative breast cancer stem cells, we show that BCSCs are markedly resistant to traditional hyperthermia and become enriched in the surviving cell population following treatment. In contrast, BCSCs are sensitive to nanotube-mediated thermal treatment and lose their long-term proliferative capacity after nanotube-mediated thermal therapy. Moreover, use of this therapy in vivo promotes complete tumor regression and long-term survival of mice bearing cancer stem cell-driven breast tumors. Mechanistically, nanotube thermal therapy promotes rapid membrane permeabilization and necrosis of BCSCs. These data suggest that nanotube-mediated thermal treatment can simultaneously eliminate both the differentiated cells that constitute the bulk of a tumor and the BCSCs that drive tumor growth and recurrence.</abstract><notes>Burke, Andrew R; Singh, Ravi N; Carroll, David L; Wood, James C S; D&apos;Agostino, Ralph B Jr; Ajayan, Pulickel M; Torti, Frank M; Torti, Suzy V; K99 CA154006-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; K99CA154006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128428-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA12842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA079448-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32CA079448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Biomaterials. 2012 Apr;33(10):2961-70.

Here, we used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to identify carbon sources taken up by liposarcoma cell lines derived from xenograft tumors in patients. Interestingly, we found that liposarcoma cell lines consume nucleosides from culture media, suggesting nucleoside salvage pathway activity. The nucleoside salvage pathway is dependent on deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and can be imaged in vivo by PET with 1-(2&apos;-deoxy-2&apos;-[18F]fluoroarabinofuranosyl) cytosine (FAC). We found that liposarcoma cell lines and xenograft tumors exhibit dCK activity and dCK-dependent FAC uptake in vitro and in vivo. In addition, liposarcoma cell lines and xenograft tumors are sensitive to treatment with the nucleoside analogue prodrug gemcitabine, and gemcitabine sensitivity is dependent on dCK expression. Elevated dCK activity is evident in 7 of 68 clinical liposarcoma samples analyzed. These data suggest that a subpopulation of liposarcoma patients have tumors with nucleoside salvage pathway activity that can be identified noninvasively using [18F]-FAC-PET and targeted using gemcitabine. SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with high-grade liposarcoma have poor prognoses and often fail to respond to chemotherapy. This report identifies elevated nucleoside salvage activity in a subset of liposarcomas that are identifiable using noninvasive PET imaging with FAC and that are sensitive to gemcitabine.

Initial efforts have primarily focused on targeting of endothelial and tumor-derived vascular endothelial growth factor signaling. As evidence emerges that angiogenesis has significant mechanistic complexity, therapeutic resistance and escape have become practical limitations to drug development. Here, we review the mechanisms by which dynamic changes occur in the tumor microenvironment in response to antiangiogenic therapy, leading to drug resistance. These mechanisms include direct selection of clonal cell populations with the capacity to rapidly upregulate alternative proangiogenic pathways, increased invasive capacity, and intrinsic resistance to hypoxia. The implications of normalization of vasculature with subsequently improved vascular function as a result of antiangiogenic therapy are explored, as are the implications of the ability to incorporate and co-opt otherwise normal vasculature. Finally, we consider the extent to which a better understanding of the biology of hypoxia and reoxygenation, as well as the depth and breadth of systems invested in angiogenesis, may offer putative biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets. Insights gained through this work may offer solutions for personalizing antiangiogenesis approaches and improving the outcome of patients with cancer.</abstract><notes>109298/PHS HHS/United States&#xD;CA 110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA101642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;P50CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;Review&#xD;United States&#xD;official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=23008289 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>480</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">480</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Benhabbour, S.

The facile incorporation of the Brij 78-NTA-Ni conjugate into the NP formulation allowed up to 90% Ni incorporation, which was a significant improvement over the previously used standard agent DOGS-NTA-Ni which led to ~6% Ni incorporation. The Ni-NPs were targeted to the highly epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-overexpressing epidermoid carcinoma cells A431. This was accomplished using a novel high affinity histidinex6-tagged EGFR-binding Z domain (heptameric Z(EGFR) domain). In vitro cell uptake studies showed enhanced internalization (up to 90%) of the targeted Ni-NPs in A431 cells with only &lt;/=10% internalization of the untargeted Ni-NPs. ICP-MS analysis used to quantify the amount of Ni in the cells were in close agreement with flow cytometry studies, which showed a dose dependent increase in the amount of Ni with the targeted Ni-NPs. Cell uptake competition studies showed that internalization of the targeted Ni-NPs within the cells was competed off with free heptameric Z(EGFR) domain at concentrations of 8.75ng/mL or higher. In vivo studies were carried out in nude mice bearing A431 tumors to determine the biodistribution and intracellular delivery. Near Infrared (NIR) optical imaging studies using Alexa750-labeled heptameric Z(EGFR) domain showed localization of 19% of the total detected fluorescence intensity in the tumor tissue, 28% in the liver and 42% in the kidneys 16h post i.v. injection. ICP-MS analysis showed almost a two-fold increase in the amount of intracellular Ni with the targeted Ni-NPs. These new Ni-NPs could be a very useful tool for targeting and drug delivery to a wide range of EGFR positive cancers.</abstract><notes>Benhabbour, S Rahima; Luft, J Christopher; Kim, Dongwook; Jain, Anekant; Wadhwa, Saurabh; Parrott, Matthew C; Liu, Rihe; DeSimone, Joseph M; Mumper, Russell J; U54 CA151652-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Netherlands; J Control Release. 2012 Feb 28;158(1):63-71.

Organic molecules can thus be patterned within microfluidic channels and still remain functional post-bonding. In addition, after polymer grafting the PDMS can be stored in a desiccator for at least 40 days, and activated upon exposure to acidic buffer for bonding. The bonded devices remain fully bonded in excess of 80 psi driving pressure, with no signs of compromise to the bond integrity. Finally, we demonstrate the compatibility of our method with biological molecules using a proof-of-concept DNA sensing device, in which fluorescently-labelled DNA targets are successfully captured by a patterned probe in a device sealed using our method, while the pattern on a plasma-treated device was completely destroyed. Therefore, this method provides a much-needed alternative bonding process for incorporation of biological molecules in microfluidic devices.</abstract><notes>Beh, Cyrus Weijie&#xD;Zhou, Weizhuang&#xD;Wang, Tza-Huei&#xD;R01CA155305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Lab Chip. 2012 Oct 21;12(20):4120-7.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22858861</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/c2lc40315c</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1128</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1128</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beaumont, K.

These studies used isolated focal adhesions, which retain many of the properties of the intracellular structures, including protein composition and force-dependent reinforcement by cytosolic proteins. The focal adhesion structures are least stable to applied force at a pH of 6.4, and significantly more stable at slightly higher and lower pH values. This trend is consistent with previous work that characterized the pH dependence of cell migration and may therefore be relevant to controlling the invasiveness of metastatic cancer cells. This approach is significant because it allows biochemical studies of large protein complexes previously studied only in cell culture, and therefore offers new opportunities for performing mechanistic studies of a range of factors that contribute to focal adhesion stability.</abstract><notes>Beaumont, Kristin Grant&#xD;Mrksich, Milan&#xD;U54 CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Howard Hughes Medical Institute/&#xD;Chem Biol. 2012 Jun 22;19(6):711-20. doi: 10.1016/j.chembiol.2012.04.016.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22726685</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3476948</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chembiol.2012.04.016</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>888</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">888</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Attarwala, H.</author><author>Amiji, M.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.</auth-address><titles><title>Multi-compartmental nanoparticles-in-emulsion formulation for macrophage-specific anti-inflammatory gene delivery</title><secondary-title>Pharm Res</secondary-title><alt-title>Pharmaceutical research</alt-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pharm Res</full-title><abbr-1>Pharmaceutical research</abbr-1></periodical><alt-periodical><full-title>Pharm Res</full-title><abbr-1>Pharmaceutical research</abbr-1></alt-periodical><pages>1637-49</pages><volume>29</volume><number>6</number><edition>2012/01/28</edition><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>Jun</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1573-904X (Electronic); 0724-8741 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>22281760</accession-num><abstract>PURPOSE: To develop a safe and effective non-viral vector for gene delivery and transfection in macrophages for potential anti-inflammatory therapy. METHODS: Solid nanoparticles-in-emulsion (NiE) multi-compartmental delivery system was designed using plasmid DNA-encapsulated type B gelatin nanoparticles suspended in the inner aqueous phase of safflower oil-containing water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) multiple emulsion. Control and NiE formulations were evaluated for DNA delivery and transfection efficiency in J774A.1 adherent murine macrophages. RESULTS: Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and murine interleukin-10 (mIL-10) expressing plasmid DNA constructs, the NiE formulation was found superior in enhancing intracellular delivery and gene transfection efficiency in cells. Anti-inflammatory effects of transfected mIL-10 were examined by suppression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results were very encouraging towards development of a macrophage-specific NiE-based multi-compartmental gene delivery strategy that can potentially affect a number of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.</abstract><notes>Attarwala, Husain; Amiji, Mansoor; R01-DK080477/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; Pharm Res. 2012 Jun;29(6):1637-49.

Here we report that mesoporous silica nanoparticle-supported lipid bilayers (or &quot;protocells&quot;) exhibit multiple properties that overcome many of the limitations of existing delivery platforms. Protocells have a 10- to 100-fold greater capacity for siRNA than corresponding lipid nanoparticles and are markedly more stable when incubated under physiological conditions. Protocells loaded with a cocktail of siRNAs bind to cells in a manner dependent on the presence of an appropriate targeting peptide and, through an endocytic pathway followed by endosomal disruption, promote delivery of the silencing nucleotides to the cytoplasm. The expression of each of the genes targeted by the siRNAs was shown to be repressed at the protein level, resulting in a potent induction of growth arrest and apoptosis. Incubation of control cells that lack expression of the antigen recognized by the targeting peptide with siRNA-loaded protocells induced neither repression of protein expression nor apoptosis, indicating the precise specificity of cytotoxic activity. In terms of loading capacity, targeting capabilities, and potency of action, protocells provide unique attributes as a delivery platform for therapeutic oligonucleotides.</abstract><notes>Ashley, Carlee E; Carnes, Eric C; Epler, Katharine E; Padilla, David P; Phillips, Genevieve K; Castillo, Robert E; Wilkinson, Dan C; Wilkinson, Brian S; Burgard, Cameron A; Kalinich, Robin M; Townson, Jason L; Chackerian, Bryce; Willman, Cheryl L; Peabody, David S; Wharton, Walker; Brinker, C Jeffrey; 1U01CA151792-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; 1U19ES019528-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/; 2 PN2 EY016570B/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2012 Mar 27;6(3):2174-88.

Next, we established and optimized conditions suitable for HTS and evaluated the assay robustness by testing the influence of a variety of physicochemical parameters (e.g., pH, temperature, time) and additives. Using known GCPII inhibitors, the FP assay was shown to be comparable to benchmark assays established in the field. Finally, we evaluated the FP assay by HTS of a 20 000-compound library. The novel assay presented here is robust, highly reproducible (Z&apos; = 0.82), inexpensive, and suitable for automation, thus providing an excellent platform for HTS of small-molecule libraries targeting GCPII.</abstract><notes>Alquicer, Glenda&#xD;Sedlak, David&#xD;Byun, Youngjoo&#xD;Pavlicek, Jiri&#xD;Stathis, Marigo&#xD;Rojas, Camilo&#xD;Slusher, Barbara&#xD;Pomper, Martin G&#xD;Bartunek, Petr&#xD;Barinka, Cyril&#xD;CA134675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;CA161056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;MH080580/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/&#xD;J Biomol Screen. 2012 Sep;17(8):1030-40. doi: 10.1177/1087057112451924.

In both applications, a call for small size nanorods is warranted. In the present work, a one-pot seedless synthetic technique has been developed to prepare relatively small monodisperse gold nanorods with average dimensions (length x width) of 18 x 4.5 nm, 25 x 5 nm, 15 x 4.5 nm, and 10 x 2.5 nm. In this method, the pH was found to play a crucial role in the monodispersity of the nanorods when the NaBH(4) concentration of the growth solution was adjusted to control the reduction rate of the gold ions. At the optimized pH and NaBH(4) concentrations, smaller gold nanorods were produced by adjusting the CTAB concentration in the growth solution. In addition, the concentration of silver ions in the growth solution was found to be pivotal in controlling the aspect ratio of the nanorods. The extinction coefficient values for the small gold nanorods synthesized with three different aspect ratios were estimated using the absorption spectra, size distributions, and the atomic spectroscopic analysis data. The previously accepted relationships between the extinction coefficient or the longitudinal band wavelength values and the nanorods&apos; aspect ratios found for the large nanorods do not extend to the small size domain reported in the present work. The failure of extending these relationships over larger sizes is a result of the interaction of light with the large rods giving an extinction band which results mostly from scattering processes while the extinction of the small nanorods results from absorption processes.</abstract><notes>Ali, Moustafa R K; Snyder, Brian; El-Sayed, Mostafa A; Langmuir. 2012 Jun 26;28(25):9807-15.

The Scano-miR system was able to detect 1 fM concentrations of miRNA in serum with single nucleotide mismatch specificity. Indeed, it provides increased sensitivity for miRNA targets compared to molecular fluorophore-based detection systems, where 88% of the low abundance miRNA targets could not be detected under identical conditions. The application of the Scano-miR platform to high density array formats demonstrates its utility for high throughput and multiplexed miRNA profiling from various biological samples. To assess the accuracy of the Scano-miR system, we analyzed the miRNA profiles of samples from men with prostate cancer (CaP), the most common noncutaneous malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer death among American men. The platform exhibits 98.8% accuracy when detecting deregulated miRNAs involved in CaP, which demonstrates its potential utility in profiling and identifying clinical and research biomarkers.</abstract><notes>Alhasan, Ali H&#xD;Kim, Dae Y&#xD;Daniel, Weston L&#xD;Watson, Erin&#xD;Meeks, Joshua J&#xD;Thaxton, C Shad&#xD;Mirkin, Chad A&#xD;U54 CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Howard Hughes Medical Institute/&#xD;Anal Chem. 2012 May 1;84(9):4153-60.

Potential benefits of this thermal therapy include reduced morbidity and mortality compared to standard surgical resection and ability to treat non-surgical patients. However, improvements to this technique are required as achieving complete ablation in many cases can be challenging particularly at margins of tumors&gt;3 cm in diameter and adjacent to blood vessels. Thus, one very promising strategy has been to combine thermal tumor ablation with adjuvant nanoparticle-based chemotherapy agents to improve efficiency. Here, we will primarily review principles of thermal ablation to provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms of combination therapy, and review the studies on combination therapy, including presenting preliminary data on the role of such variables as nanoparticle size and thermal dose on improving combination therapy outcome. We will discuss how thermal ablation can also be used to improve overall intratumoral drug accumulation and nanoparticle content release. Finally, in this article we will further describe the appealing off-shoot approach of utilizing thermal ablation techniques not as the primary treatment, but rather, as a means to improve efficiency of intratumoral nanoparticle drug delivery.</abstract><notes>Ahmed, Muneeb; Moussa, Marwan; Goldberg, S Nahum; 1U54CA151881-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; 2R01 HL55519/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 CA100045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA133114/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Ireland; Chem Phys Lipids. 2012 May;165(4):424-37.

Particle shape has been shown to be crucial in the vascular transport and adhesion of NPs. Here, we use mesoporous silicon non-spherical particles, of disk and rod shapes, ranging in size from 200nm to 1800nm. The fabrication process of the mesoporous particles is described in detail, and their transport and adhesion properties under flow are studied using a parallel plate flow chamber. Numerical simulations predict the hydrodynamic forces on the particles and help in interpreting their distinctive behaviors. Under microvascular flow conditions, for disk-like shape, 1000x400nm particles show maximum adhesion, whereas smaller (600x200nm) and larger (1800x600nm) particles adhere less by a factor of about two. Larger rods (1800x400nm) are observed to adhere at least 3 times more than smaller ones (1500x200nm). For particles of equal volumes, disks adhere about 2 times more than rods. Maximum adhesion for intermediate sized disks reflects the balance between adhesive interfacial interactions and hydrodynamic dislodging forces. In view of the growing evidence on vascular molecular heterogeneity, the present data suggests that thin disk-like particles could more effectively target the diseased microvasculature as compared to spheres and slender rods.</abstract><notes>Adriani, Giulia&#xD;de Tullio, Marco Donato&#xD;Ferrari, Mauro&#xD;Hussain, Fazle&#xD;Pascazio, Giuseppe&#xD;Liu, Xuewu&#xD;Decuzzi, Paolo&#xD;U54 CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Biomaterials. 2012 Aug;33(22):5504-13. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.027.

Static correction of aberrations may be achieved through appropriate lens design, but this approach does not offer the flexibility of simultaneously correcting aberrations for all imaging depths, nor the adaptability to correct for sample-specific aberrations for high-quality tomographic optical imaging. Incorporation of adaptive optics (AO) methods have demonstrated considerable improvement in optical image contrast and resolution in noninterferometric microscopy techniques, as well as in optical coherence tomography. Here we present a method to correct aberrations in a tomogram rather than the beam of a broadband optical interferometry system. Based on Fourier optics principles, we correct aberrations of a virtual pupil using Zernike polynomials. When used in conjunction with the computed imaging method interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy, this computational AO enables object reconstruction (within the single scattering limit) with ideal focal-plane resolution at all depths. Tomographic reconstructions of tissue phantoms containing subresolution titanium-dioxide particles and of ex vivo rat lung tissue demonstrate aberration correction in datasets acquired with a highly astigmatic illumination beam. These results also demonstrate that imaging with an aberrated astigmatic beam provides the advantage of a more uniform depth-dependent signal compared to imaging with a standard gaussian beam. With further work, computational AO could enable the replacement of complicated and expensive optical hardware components with algorithms implemented on a standard desktop computer, making high-resolution 3D interferometric tomography accessible to a wider group of users and nonspecialists.</abstract><notes>Adie, Steven G; Graf, Benedikt W; Ahmad, Adeel; Carney, P Scott; Boppart, Stephen A; R01 EB012479/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB012479-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 May 8;109(19):7175-80.

The effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of ribonucleotide reductase subunit-2 (RRM2), a rate-limiting enzyme in cell replication, were investigated in malignant melanoma, a cancer with a paucity of effective treatment options. A panel of human melanoma cell lines was transfected with siRNA to induce the knockdown of RRM2. Sequence-specific, siRNA-mediated inhibition of RRM2 effectively blocked cell proliferation and induced G1/S-phase cell cycle arrest. This effect was independent of the activating oncogenic mutations in the tested cell lines. Synergistic inhibition of melanoma cell proliferation was achieved using the combination of siRNA targeting RRM2 and temozolomide, an analog of the current standard of care for melanoma chemotherapy. In conclusion, siRNA-mediated RRM2 knockdown significantly inhibits proliferation of melanoma cell lines with different oncogenic mutations with synergistic enhancement in combination with temozolomide.</abstract><notes>Zuckerman, Jonathan E; Hsueh, Teli; Koya, Richard C; Davis, Mark E; Ribas, Antoni; AI-28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/; CA-16042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 GM008042/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U54 CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Invest Dermatol. 2011 Feb;131(2):453-60.

Inability of complete removal of tumor lesions after surgery causes local recurrence and increases the incidence of developing tumor metastasis. It is clear that novel approaches that allow defining tumor margins intraoperatively for removal of small tumor lesions in the surgical cavity is critical for improving prognosis of cancer patients. To facilitate image-guided surgery using targeted optical imaging probes, we have developed a reflection-mode fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) system with a handheld probe that is able to provide three-dimensional tumor margin information. METHODS: The imaging method and system were validated using both simulated and phantom experiments. We further examined the accuracy of the handheld FMT system in an orthotopic mouse mammary tumor model following systemic delivery of near-infrared (NIR) dye-labeled and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor targeted magnet iron oxide nanoparticles. RESULTS: Our results show that when the targets are located within 5 mm beneath the surface of the media, fluorescent images can be reliably detected and reconstructed with an average positional error of 0.5 mm laterally and 1.5 mm axially. For in vivo imaging in the mouse tumor model, the location and size of the tumor detected by FMT correlated well with that measured by the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CONCLUSIONS: Our system can three-dimensionally image targets located at a depth of up to 7 mm. The in vivo results suggest that in combination with targeted optical imaging probes, this handheld FMT system can be potentially used as an intraoperative tool for the detection of tumor margins and for image-guided surgery.</abstract><notes>Zhao, Qing; Jiang, Huabei; Cao, Zehong; Yang, Lily; Mao, Hui; Lipowska, Malgorzata; R01 CA133722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Med Phys. 2011 Nov;38(11):5873-8.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22047351</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3210188</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1118/1.3641877</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1262</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1262</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Y.</author><author>Wang, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantum Dots-Enabled High-Resolution Analysis of Gene Copy Number Variation</title><secondary-title>Nanotechnology Magazine, IEEE</secondary-title></titles><pages>23-27</pages><volume>5</volume><number>2</number><keywords><keyword>DNA</keyword><keyword>biological techniques</keyword><keyword>electrophoresis</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>molecular biophysics</keyword><keyword>molecular configurations</keyword><keyword>nanobiotechnology</keyword><keyword>quantum dots</keyword><keyword>QD-DNA nanocomplex band broadening</keyword><keyword>Rsf-1 gene CNV</keyword><keyword>electrophoretic migration</keyword><keyword>electrophoretic mobility levels</keyword><keyword>gene copy number variation</keyword><keyword>high resolution analysis</keyword><keyword>ovarian cancer</keyword><keyword>quantum dot enabled CNV quantification assay</keyword><keyword>target copy number</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>1932-4510</isbn><urls><related-urls><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5871464&amp;tag=1</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/mnano.2011.940950</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1254</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1254</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Y.</author><author>Park, S.</author><author>Liu, K.</author><author>Tsuan, J.</author><author>Yang, S.</author><author>Wang, T.

The platform exploited the dual functionality of silica superparamagnetic particles (SSP) for solid phase extraction of DNA and magnetic actuation. This enabled the integration of sample preparation and genetic analysis within discrete droplets, including the steps of cell lysis, DNA binding, washing, elution, amplification and detection. The microfluidic device was self contained, with all reagents stored in droplets, thereby eliminating the need for fluidic coupling to external reagent reservoirs. The device incorporated unique surface topographic features to assist droplet manipulation. Pairs of micro-elevations were created to form slits that facilitated efficient splitting of SSP from droplets. In addition, a compact sample handling stage, which integrated the magnet manipulator, the droplet microfluidic device and a Peltier thermal cycler, was built for convenient droplet manipulation and real-time detection. The feasibility of the platform was demonstrated by analysing ovarian cancer biomarker Rsf-1 and detecting Escherichia coli with real time polymerase chain reaction and real time helicase dependent amplification.</abstract><notes>Zhang, Yi&#xD;Park, Seungkyung&#xD;Liu, Kelvin&#xD;Tsuan, Jennifer&#xD;Yang, Samuel&#xD;Wang, Tza-Huei&#xD;R21-CA120742/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54-AI057168-07/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Lab Chip. 2011 Feb 7;11(3):398-406.

An approach has been developed for increasing Paclitaxel solubility and effectiveness by covalent attachment to gold nanoparticles via DNA linkers. The resulting conjugates are highly soluble in aqueous buffer, exhibiting greater than a 50-fold increase in solubility over the unconjugated drug. DNA linkers are labeled with a fluorophore, which affords a convenient means of visualizing resultant conjugates within cells. Internalized conjugates demonstrate increased activity as compared with free drug across a variety of cell types, including a Paclitaxel-resistant cell line.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Solutions of IONPs with different core sizes and concentrations were prepared. T(1) and T(2) relaxation times of IONPs were measured using the inversion recovery turbo spin echo (TSE) and multi-echo spin echo sequences at 3 Tesla. T(1) -weighted UTE gradient echo and T(2)-weighted TSE sequences were used to image IONP samples. U87MG glioblastoma cells bound with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide and IONP conjugates were scanned using UTE, T(1) and T(2)-weighted sequences. RESULTS: Positive contrast was obtained by UTE imaging from IONPs with different core sizes and concentrations. The relative-contrast-to-water ratio of UTE images was three to four times higher than those of T(2)-weighted TSE images. The signal intensity increases as the function of the core size and concentration. Positive contrast was also evident in cell samples bound with RGD-IONPs. CONCLUSION: UTE imaging allows for imaging of IONPs and IONP bound tumor cells with positive contrast and provides contrast enhancement and potential quantification of IONPs in molecular imaging applications.</abstract><notes>Zhang, Longjiang; Zhong, Xiaodong; Wang, Liya; Chen, Hongwei; Wang, Y Andrew; Yeh, Julie; Yang, Lily; Mao, Hui; P50CA128301-01A10003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119338-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Magn Reson Imaging. 2011 Jan;33(1):194-202. doi: 10.1002/jmri.22412.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21182139</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmri.22412</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>164</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">164</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zavaleta, C.

However, its limited depth of light penetration makes direct clinical translation challenging. Therefore, a more suitable way to harness its attributes in a clinical setting would be to couple Raman spectroscopy with endoscopy. The use of an accessory Raman endoscope in conjunction with topically administered tumor-targeting Raman nanoparticles during a routine colonoscopy could offer a new way to sensitively detect dysplastic lesions while circumventing Raman&apos;s limited depth of penetration and avoiding systemic toxicity. In this study, the natural biodistribution of gold surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles is evaluated by radiolabeling them with (64) Cu and imaging their localization over time using micropositron emission tomography (PET). Mice are injected either intravenously (IV) or intrarectally (IR) with approximately 100 microcuries (μCi) (3.7 megabecquerel (MBq)) of (64) Cu-SERS nanoparticles and imaged with microPET at various time points post injection. Quantitative biodistribution data are obtained as % injected dose per gram (%ID g(-1)) from each organ, and the results correlate well with the corresponding microPET images, revealing that IV-injected mice have significantly higher uptake (p &lt; 0.05) in the liver (5 h = 8.96% ID g(-1); 24 h = 8.27% ID g(-1)) than IR-injected mice (5 h = 0.09% ID g(-1); 24 h = 0.08% ID g(-1)). IR-injected mice show localized uptake in the large intestine (5 h = 10.37% ID g(-1); 24 h = 0.42% ID g(-1)) with minimal uptake in other organs. Raman imaging of excised tissues correlate well with biodistribution data. These results suggest that the topical application of SERS nanoparticles in the mouse colon appears to minimize their systemic distribution, thus avoiding potential toxicity and supporting the clinical translation of Raman spectroscopy as an endoscopic imaging tool.</abstract><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21608124</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/smll.201002317</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>493</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">493</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zamboni, W.

We evaluated the relationship between monocyte and absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) in the blood and pharmacokinetic disposition of S-CKD602 and nonliposomal CKD-602 (NL-CKD602) in patients. METHODS: As part of a phase I study of S-CKD602 and phase I and II studies of NL-CKD602, the percent decreases in ANC and monocytes at their nadir were calculated. After S-CKD602, the amount of CKD-602 recovered in urine was measured. RESULTS: For S-CKD602 in patients &lt;60 years, the percent decrease in ANC and monocytes were 43 +/- 31 and 58 +/- 26%, respectively (P = 0.001). For S-CKD602 in patients &gt;/=60, the percent decrease in ANC and monocytes were 41 +/- 31 and 45 +/- 36%, respectively (P = 0.50). For NL-CKD602 (n = 42), the percent decrease in ANC and monocytes were similar (P &gt; 0.05). For S-CKD602, the relationship between the percent decrease in monocytes and CKD-602 recovered in urine was stronger in patients &lt;60 (R(2) = 0.82), compared with patients &gt;/=60 (R(2) = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: Monocytes are more sensitive to S-CKD602, compared with neutrophils, and the increased sensitivity is related to the liposomal formulation, not CKD-602. These results suggest that monocytes engulf S-CKD602, which causes the release of CKD-602 from the liposome and toxicity to the monocytes, and that the effects are more prominent in patients &lt;60.</abstract><notes>Zamboni, William C; Maruca, Lauren J; Strychor, Sandra; Zamboni, Beth A; Ramalingam, Suresh; Edwards, Robert P; Kim, Jk; Bang, Yj; Lee, Hy; Friedland, David M; Stoller, Ronald G; Belani, Chandra P; Ramanathan, Ramesh K; England; J Liposome Res. 2011 Jun;21(2):158-65. doi: 10.3109/08982104.2010.496085.

The relationship between plasma and tumor disposition of S-CKD602 and RES was evaluated in mice bearing A375 melanoma or SKOV-3 ovarian xenografts. Area under the concentration-time curves (AUCs) of liposomal encapsulated, released, and sum total (encapsulated + released) CKD-602 in plasma, tumor, and tumor extracellular fluid (ECF) were estimated. A375 and SKOV-3 tumors were stained with cd11b and cd11c antibodies as measures of macrophages and DC. The plasma disposition of S-CKD602 was similar in both xenograft models. The ratio of tumor sum total AUC to plasma sum total AUC was 1.7-fold higher in mice bearing human SKOV-3 xenografts, compared with A375. The ratio of tumor ECF AUC to tumor sum total AUC was 2-fold higher in mice bearing human SKOV-3 xenografts, compared with A375. The staining of cd11c was 4.5-fold higher in SKOV-3, compared with A375 (P &lt; 0.0001). The increased tumor delivery and release of CKD-602 from S-CKD602 in the ovarian xenografts, compared with the melanoma xenografts, was consistent with increased cd11c staining, suggesting that variability in the RES may affect the tumor disposition of liposomal agents.</abstract><notes>Zamboni, William C; Eiseman, Julie L; Strychor, Sandra; Rice, Patricia M; Joseph, Erin; Zamboni, Beth A; Donnelly, Mark K; Shurer, Jennifer; Parise, Robert A; Tonda, Margaret E; Yu, Ning Y; Basse, Per H; England; J Liposome Res. 2011 Mar;21(1):70-80.

They are an emerging class of targeting ligand that show great promise for treating a number of diseases. A series of aptamers currently in various stages of clinical development highlights the potential of aptamers for therapeutic applications. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review covers in vitro selection of oligonucleotide ligands, called aptamers, from a combinatorial library using the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment process as well as the other known strategies for finding aptamers against various targets. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Readers will gain an understanding of the highly useful strategies for successful aptamer discovery. They may also be able to combine two or more of the presented strategies for their aptamer discovery projects. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Although many processes are available for discovering aptamers, it is not easy to discover an aptamer candidate that is ready to move toward pharmaceutical drug development. It is also apparent that there have been relatively few therapeutic advances and clinical trials undertaken due to the small number of companies that participate in aptamer development.</abstract><notes>Yang, Xianbin&#xD;Li, Na&#xD;Gorenstein, David G&#xD;AI 27744/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/&#xD;GM 084552/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;HHSN 272200800048C/PHS HHS/&#xD;HHSN272200800048C/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/&#xD;N01 HV028184/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;N01-HV-28184/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 AI027744-17/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA128797-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R44 GM084552-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;RC2 GM092599-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;RC2GM092599ARRA/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2011 Jan;6(1):75-87.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21359096</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3045091</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1517/17460441.2011.537321</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>700</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">700</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, W.</author><author>Ahmed, M.</author><author>Tasawwar, B.</author><author>Levchenko, T.</author><author>Sawant, R.

METHODS: Sixty R3230 breast adenocarcinoma tumours/animals were used in this IACUC-approved study. Initially, 60 tumours (n=6, each subgroup) were randomised into five groups: (1) RF alone, (2) intravenous (IV) liposomal quercetin alone (1 mg/kg), (3) IV liposomal quercetin followed 24 h later with RF, (4) RF followed 15 min later by IV liposomal doxorubicin (8 mg/kg), (5) IV liposomal quercetin 24 h before RF followed by IV liposomal doxorubicin 15 min post-ablation. Animals were sacrificed 4 or 24 h post-treatment and gross coagulation diameters were compared. Next, immunohistochemistry staining was performed for Hsp70 and cleaved caspase-3 expression. Comparisons were performed by using Student t-tests or ANOVA. RESULTS: Combination RF-quercetin significantly increased coagulation size compared with either RF or liposomal quercetin alone (13.1+/-0.7 mm vs. 8.8+/-1.2 mm or 2.3+/-1.3 mm, respectively, P&lt;0.001 for all comparisons). Triple therapy (quercetin-RF-doxorubicin) showed larger coagulation diameter (14.5+/-1.0 mm) at 24 h than quercetin-RF (P=0.016) or RF-doxorubicin (13.2+/-1.3 mm, P=0.042). Combination quercetin-RF decreased Hsp70 expression compared with RF alone at both 4 h (percentage of stained cells/hpf 22.4+/-13.9% vs. 38.8+/-16.1%, P&lt;0.03) and 24 h (45.2+/-10.5% vs. 81.1+/-3.6%, P&lt;0.001). Quercetin-RF increased cleaved caspase-3 expression at both 4 h (percentage of stained cells/hpf 50.7+/-13.4% vs. 41.9+/-15.1%, P&lt;0.03) and 24 h (37.4+/-7.8% vs. 33.2+/-6.5%, P=0.045); with, triple therapy (quercetin-RF-doxorubicin) resulting in the highest levels of apoptosis (45.1+/-10.7%) at 24 h. Similar trends were observed for rim thickness. Conclusions: Suppression of HSP production using adjuvant liposomal quercetin can increase apoptosis and improve RF ablation-induced tumour destruction. Further increases in tumour coagulation can be seen including an additional anti-tumour adjuvant agent such as liposomal doxorubicin.</abstract><notes>Yang, Wei; Ahmed, Muneeb; Tasawwar, Beenish; Levchenko, Tatyana; Sawant, Rupa R; Collins, Michael; Signoretti, Sabina; Torchilin, Vladimir; Goldberg, S Nahum; 1U54CA151881-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; 2R01 HL55519/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 CA100045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA133114/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Int J Hyperthermia. 2011;27(6):527-38.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21846189</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.3109/02656736.2011.582474</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1253</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1253</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, M</author><author>Lai, S K.</author><author>Wang, Y</author><author>Zhong, W</author><author>Happe, C</author><author>Zhang, M</author><author>Fu, J</author><author>Hanes, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biodegradable Nanoparticles Composed Entirely of Safe Materials that Rapidly Penetrate Human Mucus</title><secondary-title>Angewandte Chemie International Edition</secondary-title></titles><pages>2597-2600</pages><volume>50</volume><number>11</number><keywords><keyword>drug delivery</keyword><keyword>GRAS (generally recognized as safe)</keyword><keyword>mucus-penetrating particles</keyword><keyword>nanotechnology</keyword><keyword>Pluronics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>WILEY-VCH Verlag</publisher><isbn>1521-3773</isbn><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201006849</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/anie.201006849</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1344</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1344</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, J.</author><author>Sandoval, S.</author><author>Alfaro, J.

However, DBT scanners based on rotation gantry prolong the imaging time and reduce spatial resolution due to motion comparing with the regular two-view mammography. To obtain three dimension reconstruction images and maintain the high image quality of conventional mammography, we proposed a prototype stationary digital breast tomosynthesis system (s-DBT). The proposed s-DBT system acquires projection images without mechanical movement. The core component of the s-DBT system is a specially designed spatially distributed multi-beam x-ray tube based on the carbon nanotube field emission x-ray technology. The multi-beam x-ray source array enables collection of all projection images from different viewing angles without mechanical motion. Preliminary results show the s-DBT system can achieve a scan time comparable to the regular two-view mammography, and improve the spatial resolution comparing with rotating gantry DBT.</abstract><notes>Yang, G&#xD;Qian, X&#xD;Phan, T&#xD;Sprenger, F&#xD;Sultana, S&#xD;Calderon-Colon, X&#xD;Kearse, B&#xD;Spronk, D&#xD;Lu, J&#xD;Zhou, O&#xD;R01 CA134598-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA134598-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA134598-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA134598-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119343-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Nucl Instrum Methods Phys Res A. 2011 Aug 21;648(Suppl 1):S220-S223.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21808428</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3146055</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.nima.2010.11.147</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>682</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">682</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yan, X.</author><author>Ma, L.</author><author>Yi, D.</author><author>Yoon, J.

The transmembrane protein CD133 has been widely used to isolate putative CSC populations in several cancer types, but its validity as a CSC marker and hence its clinical ramifications remain controversial. Here, we conducted transcriptomic profiling of sorted CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells from human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and, by subtractive analysis, established a CD133 gene expression signature composed of 214 differentially expressed genes. Extensive computational comparisons with a compendium of published gene expression profiles reveal that the CD133 gene signature transcriptionally resembles human ES cells and in vitro cultured GBM stem cells, and this signature successfully distinguishes GBM from lower-grade gliomas. More importantly, the CD133 gene signature identifies an aggressive subtype of GBM seen in younger patients with shorter survival who bear excessive genomic mutations as surveyed through the Cancer Genome Atlas Network GBM mutation spectrum. Furthermore, the CD133 gene signature distinguishes higher-grade breast and bladder cancers from their lower-grade counterparts. Our systematic analysis provides molecular and genetic support for the stem cell-like nature of CD133(+) cells and an objective means for evaluating cancer aggressiveness.</abstract><notes>Yan, Xiaowei; Ma, Li; Yi, Danielle; Yoon, Jae-geun; Diercks, Alan; Foltz, Gregory; Price, Nathan D; Hood, Leroy E; Tian, Qiang; P01 DK053074/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; P50 GM076547/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R00 CA126184-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21 CA135339-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 DA021519/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jan 25;108(4):1591-6.

Here we report the development and application of a targeted proteomics platform termed index-ion triggered MS2 ion quantification (iMSTIQ) that allows reproducible and accurate peptide quantification in complex mixtures. The key feature of iMSTIQ is an approach called index-ion triggered analysis (ITA) that permits the reproducible acquisition of full MS2 spectra of targeted peptides independent of their ion intensities. Accurate quantification is achieved by comparing the relative intensities of multiple pairs of fragment ions derived from isobaric targeted peptides during MS2 analysis. Importantly, the method takes advantage of the favorable performance characteristics of the LTQ-Orbitrap, which include high mass accuracy, resolution, and throughput. As such it provides an attractive targeted proteomics tool to meet the demands of systems biology research and biomarker studies.</abstract><notes>Yan, Wei; Luo, Jie; Robinson, Max; Eng, Jimmy; Aebersold, Ruedi; Ranish, Jeffrey; N01-HV-28179/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/; PM50 GM076547/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; Mol Cell Proteomics. 2011 Mar;10(3):M110.005611.

The process involved polymer coated 30 nm IO that was modified with antibodies (Ab) against human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (anti-HER2 or anti-HER2/neu) forming IO-Ab. HER2 is a cell membrane protein that is overexpressed in several types of human cancer cells. Using a HER2/neu overexpressing human breast cancer cell line, SK-BR3, as a model cell, the IO-Ab was used to separate 73.6% (with a maximum capture of 84%) of SK-BR3 cells that were spiked in 1 mL of fresh human whole blood. The IO-Ab preferentially bound to SK-BR3 cells over normal cells found in blood due to the high level of HER2/neu receptor on the cancer cells unlike the normal cell surfaces. The results showed that the nanosized magnetic nanoparticles exhibited an enrichment factor (cancer cells over normal cells) of 1:10,000,000 in a magnetic field (with gradient of 100 T/m) through the binding of IO-Ab on the cell surface that resulted in the preferential capture of the cancer cells. This research holds promise for efficient separation of circulating cancer cells in fresh whole blood.</abstract><notes>Xu, Hengyi; Aguilar, Zoraida P; Yang, Lily; Kuang, Min; Duan, Hongwei; Xiong, Yonghua; Wei, Hua; Wang, Andrew; 1 R43 CA134066/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; 5 R44 RR028019-03/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; England; Biomaterials. 2011 Dec;32(36):9758-65.

We show that the immobilization of reporters on collagens in the local microenvironment is highly efficient and physiologically stable for repetitive, long-term imaging. By using this strategy we successfully developed an immobilized bioluminescent activatable reporter and a dual-modality reporter to map and quantitatively image the activity of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in tumor-bearing mice. The inhibition of MMP activity by chemical inhibitor was also demonstrated in living subjects. We further demonstrated the general applicability of this immobilization strategy by imaging MMP activity at the inflammation site in a mouse model.

A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for encapsulated and released CKD-602 following administration of S-CKD602 was developed to assess factors that may influence S-CKD602 PK. Plasma samples from 45 patients with solid tumors were collected in a phase 1 study. S-CKD602 was administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion with doses ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 mg/m(2). Plasma concentrations of encapsulated and released CKD-602 were used to develop a population PK model using NONMEM. PK of encapsulated CKD-602 was described by a 1-compartment model with nonlinear clearance, and PK of released CKD-602 was described by a 2-compartment model with linear clearance for all patients. Covariate analysis revealed that tumor in the liver was a significant covariate for clearance of encapsulated CKD-602 and that age significantly influenced the release rate of CKD-602 from S-CKD602. Maximum elimination rate in patients with liver tumor is 1.5-fold higher compared with patients without liver tumor. Release rate of CKD-602 from S-CKD602 in patients less than 60 years old was 2.7-fold higher compared with patients 60 years old or older. These observations have potential implications in the optimal dosing of liposomal agents.</abstract><notes>J Clin Pharmacol. 2011 Jan 13.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21233302</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0091270010394851</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1251</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1251</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wong, N.

This suboptimal outcome is likely due to physiological barriers that hinder delivery of the nanotherapeutics throughout the tumor. Many of these nanotherapeutics are approximately 100 nm in diameter and exhibit enhanced accumulation around the leaky regions of the tumor vasculature, but their large size hinders penetration into the dense collagen matrix. Therefore, we propose a multistage system in which 100-nm nanoparticles &quot;shrink&quot; to 10-nm nanoparticles after they extravasate from leaky regions of the tumor vasculature and are exposed to the tumor microenvironment. The shrunken nanoparticles can more readily diffuse throughout the tumor&apos;s interstitial space. This size change is triggered by proteases that are highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment such as MMP-2, which degrade the cores of 100-nm gelatin nanoparticles, releasing smaller 10-nm nanoparticles from their surface. We used quantum dots (QD) as a model system for the 10-nm particles because their fluorescence can be used to demonstrate the validity of our approach. In vitro MMP-2 activation of the multistage nanoparticles revealed that the size change was efficient and effective in the enhancement of diffusive transport. In vivo circulation half-life and intratumoral diffusion measurements indicate that our multistage nanoparticles exhibited both the long circulation half-life necessary for the EPR effect and the deep tumor penetration required for delivery into the tumor&apos;s dense collagen matrix.</abstract><notes>Wong, Cliff; Stylianopoulos, Triantafyllos; Cui, Jian; Martin, John; Chauhan, Vikash P; Jiang, Wen; Popovic, Zoran; Jain, Rakesh K; Bawendi, Moungi G; Fukumura, Dai; 1U54-CA119349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA126642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01 CA080124-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01 CA080124-05S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01 CA080124-06A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01 CA080124-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01 CA080124-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01 CA080124-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01 CA080124-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01-CA080124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA085140-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA085140-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA085140-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA085140-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA085140-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA096915-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA096915-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA115767-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA115767-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA115767-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA115767-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA115767-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA126642-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA126642-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA126642-02S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA126642-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA126642-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA126642-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01-CA085140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01-CA096915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01-CA115767/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA073479-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA073479-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA073479-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA073479-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA073479-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA073479-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Feb 8;108(6):2426-31.

Our Raman-active nanoparticles are fabricated using nanoimprint lithography and thin-film deposition and are composed of novel internal structures with sublithographic dimensions: a disk-shaped Ag core, a Petri-dish-shaped SiO(2) base whose inner surface is coated with Ag film, and a sub-10 nm scale circular gap between the core and the base. Confocal Raman measurements and electromagnetic simulations show that Raman hot spots appear at the inside perimeter of individual nanoparticles and serve as the source of a 1000-fold improvement of minimum molecular detection level that enables detection of signals from a few molecules near hot spots. A multimodality version of these nanoparticles, which includes the functionality offered by magnetic multilayers, is also demonstrated. These results illustrate the potential of direct fabrication for creating exotic monodisperse nanoparticles, which combine engineered internal nanostructures and multilayer composite materials, for use in nanoparticle-based molecular imaging and detection.</abstract><notes>Wi, Jung-Sub; Barnard, Edward S; Wilson, Robert J; Zhang, Mingliang; Tang, Mary; Brongersma, Mark L; Wang, Shan X; 1U54CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; 1U54CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R33CA138330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; United States; ACS nano; ACS Nano. 2011 Aug 23;5(8):6449-57.

PROCEDURE: A fragment of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) was fused into a protein-based MRI contrast agent (ProCA1) at different regions. MR imaging was obtained in both tumor cells (PC3 and H441) and a tumor mouse model administrated with ProCA1.GRP. RESULTS: PC3 and DU145 cells treated with ProCA1.GRPs exhibited enhanced signal in MRI. Intratumoral injection of ProCA1.GRP in a PC3 tumor model displayed enhanced MRI signal. The contrast agent was retained in the PC3 tumor up to 48 h post-injection. CONCLUSIONS: Protein-based MRI contrast agent with tumor targeting modality can specifically target GRPR-positive prostate cancer. Intratumoral injection of the ProCA1 agent in the prostate cancer mouse model verified the targeting capability of ProCA1.GRP and showed a prolonged retention time in tumors.</abstract><notes>Wei, Lixia; Li, Shunyi; Yang, Jianhua; Ye, Yiming; Zou, Jin; Wang, Liya; Long, Robert; Zurkiya, Omar; Zhao, Tiejun; Johnson, Julian; Qiao, Jingjuan; Zhou, Wangda; Castiblanco, Adriana; Maor, Natalie; Chen, Yanyi; Mao, Hui; Hu, Xiaoping; Yang, Jenny J; Liu, Zhi-Ren; CA118113/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB007268/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; GM62999/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 EB007268-04/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 GM062999-05/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM081749-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; Mol Imaging Biol. 2011 Jun;13(3):416-23.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20574851</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11307-010-0342-9</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>334</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">334</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Webber, M.

In principle, one route to make these nanostructures more biomimetic would be to incorporate in their molecular design the capacity for biological sensing. We report here on the use of a reversible enzymatic trigger to control the assembly and disassembly of peptide amphiphile (PA) nanostructures. The PA used in these studies contained a consensus substrate sequence specific to protein kinase A (PKA), a biological enzyme important for intracellular signaling that has also been shown to be an extracellular cancer biomarker. Upon treatment with PKA, this PA molecule becomes phosphorylated causing the high aspect-ratio filamentous PA nanostructures to disassemble. Treatment with an enzyme to cleave the phosphate group results in reformation of the filamentous nanostructures. We also show that disassembly in the presence of PKA allows the enzyme-triggered release of an encapsulated cancer drug. In addition, these drug-loaded nanostructures were found to induce preferential cytotoxicity in a cancer cell line that is known to secrete high levels of PKA. This ability to control nanostructure through an enzymatic switch could allow for the preparation of highly sophisticated and biomimetic materials that incorporate a biological sensing capability to enable therapeutic specificity.</abstract><notes>R01 DE015920-05/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/; R01 EB003806-06A2/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; T90 DA022881-04/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/; U54 CA151880-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Soft Matter. 2011 Oct 21;7(20):9665-9672.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22408645</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3293180</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/c1sm05610g</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1314</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1314</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weaver, J.B.</author><author>Rauwerdink, A.

With an increasing emphasis on the personalization of medicine and the rising costs of health care, early detection and diagnostics at the POC will be even more important. Early detection implies early intervention, resulting in the saving of lives and reducing overall spending. The potential impact of these technologies on the early diagnosis and management of both communicable and noncommunicable diseases is very high. Many grand challenges applications are possible, e.g., routine tests such as complete blood cell count on a chip that an individual can perform at home; detection of cardiac markers from blood after a perceived heart attack; detection of cancer markers such as exosomes, CTCs from blood, or protein biomarkers in serum; and detection of infectious agents such as virus and bacteria for public health. These applications are expected to result in new diagnostic assays for home, doctor&apos;s office, clinical laboratories, and various POC settings.</abstract><notes>Watkins, Nicholas&#xD;Irimia, Daniel&#xD;Toner, Mehmet&#xD;Bashir, Rashid&#xD;P41 EB002503/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA120003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R25 CA154015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;IEEE Pulse. 2011 Nov;2(6):19-27.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22147065</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/MPUL.2011.942762</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>487</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">487</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Y.</author><author>Merkel, T.

The CPE and OPE compounds exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, and cell walls and membranes are believed to be their main targets. To better understand how the size, in terms of the number of repeat units, of the CPEs and OPEs affects their membrane disruption activities, a series of PPE-based CPEs and OPEs were synthesized and studied. A number of photophysical techniques were used to investigate the interactions of CPEs and OPEs with model membranes, including unilamellar vesicles and lipid monolayers at the air/water interface. CPE- or OPE-induced dye leakage from vesicles reveals that the CPEs and OPEs selectively perturb model bacterial membranes and that their membrane perturbation abilities are highly dependent on molecular size. Consistent with dye-leakage assay results, the CPEs and OPEs also exhibit chain-length-dependent ability to insert into 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1&apos;-rac-glycerol) (DPPG) monolayers. Our results suggest that, for PPE-based CPE and OPE antimicrobials, chain length can be tuned to optimize their membrane perturbation ability.</abstract><notes>Wang, Ying; Jones, Emmalee M; Tang, Yanli; Ji, Eunkyung; Lopez, Gabriel P; Chi, Eva Y; Schanze, Kirk S; Whitten, David G; Langmuir. 2011 Sep 6;27(17):10770-5.

Here we report a new method using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to directly measure targeted CTCs in the presence of white blood cells. SERS nanoparticles with epidermal growth factor peptide as a targeting ligand have successfully identified CTCs in the peripheral blood of 19 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), with a range of 1 to 720 CTCs per milliliter of whole blood.

The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of a folate receptor-targeting nanoparticle to overcome/minimize drug resistance and to explore the underlying mechanisms. This is accomplished with enhanced cellular accumulation and retention of paclitaxel (one of the most effective anticancer drugs in use today and a well-known P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate) in a P-gp-overexpressing cancer model. The folate receptor-targeted nanoparticle, HFT-T, consists of a heparin-folate-paclitaxel (HFT) backbone with an additional paclitaxel (T) loaded in its hydrophobic core. In vitro analyses demonstrated that the HFT-T nanoparticle was superior to free paclitaxel or nontargeted nanoparticle (HT-T) in inhibiting proliferation of P-gp-overexpressing cancer cells (KB-8-5), partially due to its enhanced uptake and prolonged intracellular retention. In a subcutaneous KB-8-5 xenograft model, HFT-T administration enhanced the specific delivery of paclitaxel into tumor tissues and remarkably prolonged retention within tumor tissues. Importantly, HFT-T treatment markedly retarded tumor growth in a xenograft model of resistant human squamous cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis further indicated that increased in vivo efficacy of HFT-T nanoparticles was associated with a higher degree of microtubule stabilization, mitotic arrest, antiangiogenic activity, and inhibition of cell proliferation. These findings suggest that when the paclitaxel was delivered as an HFT-T nanoparticle, the drug is better retained within the P-gp-overexpressing cells than the free form of paclitaxel. These results indicated that the targeted HFT-T nanoparticle may be promising in minimizing P-gp related drug resistance and enhancing therapeutic efficacy compared with the free form of paclitaxel.</abstract><notes>Wang, Xu; Li, Jun; Wang, Yuxiang; Koenig, Lydia; Gjyrezi, Ada; Giannakakou, Paraskevi; Shin, Edwin H; Tighiouart, Mourad; Chen, Zhuo Georgia; Nie, Shuming; Shin, Dong M; P50CA128613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 CA151802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA119338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2011 Aug 23;5(8):6184-94.

We explored the direct use of landscape phage fusion proteins for the self-assembly of phage-derived binding peptides to liposomes for cancer cell targeting. The primary purpose of this study was to elucidate the targeting mechanism with a particular emphasis on the relative contributions of the two motifs that make up the landscape phage fusion protein (a binding peptide and the phage pVIII coat protein) to the targeting efficiency. Using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering, we confirmed the formation of phage-liposomes. Using FACS analysis, fluorescence microscopy, and fluorescence photospectrometry, we found that liposomes modified with MCF-7-specific phage fusion proteins (MCF-7 binding peptide, DMPGTVLP, fused to the phage PVIII coat protein) provided a strong and specific association with target MCF-7 cancer cells but not with cocultured, nontarget cells including C166-GFP and NIH3T3. The substitution for the binding peptide fused to phage pVIII coat protein abolished the targeting specificity. The addition of free binding peptide, DMPGTVLP, competitively inhibited the interaction of MCF-7-specific phage-liposomes with target MCF-7 cells but showed no reduction of MCF-7-associated plain liposomes. The proteolysis of the binding peptide reduced MCF-7 cell-associated phage-liposomes in a proteinase K (PK) concentration-dependent manner with no effect on the binding of plain liposomes to MCF-7 cells. Overall, only the binding peptide motif was involved in the targeting specificity of phage-liposomes. The presence of phage pVIII coat protein did not interfere with the targeting efficiency.</abstract><notes>Wang, Tao; Kulkarni, Nikita; D&apos;Souza, Gerard G M; Petrenko, Valery A; Torchilin, Vladimir P; 1U54CA151881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA125063-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA125063-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151881-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Mol Pharm. 2011 Oct 3;8(5):1720-8.

Although the polycomb group gene, Bmi-1 that regulates the self-renewal of normal stem and progenitor cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human malignancies, yet a role for Bmi-1 in influencing chemotherapy response has not been addressed before. Here we demonstrate that silencing Bmi-1 reduces intracellular GSH levels and thereby sensitizes chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin. By exacerbating ROS production in response to cisplatin, Bmi-1 silencing activates the DNA damage response pathway, caspases and cleaves PARP resulting in the induction apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. In an in vivo orthotopic mouse model of chemoresistant ovarian cancer, knockdown of Bmi-1 by nanoliposomal delivery significantly inhibits tumor growth. While cisplatin monotherapy was inactive, combination of Bmi-1 silencing along with cisplatin almost completely abrogated ovarian tumor growth. Collectively these findings establish Bmi-1 as an important new target for therapy in chemoresistant ovarian cancer.</abstract><notes>Wang, Enfeng; Bhattacharyya, Sanjib; Szabolcs, Annamaria; Rodriguez-Aguayo, Cristian; Jennings, Nicholas B; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Mukherjee, Priyabrata; Sood, Anil K; Bhattacharya, Resham; CA135011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA136494/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA136494-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; PLoS One. 2011 Mar 21;6(3):e17918.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21445297</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3061867</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0017918</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>777</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">777</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>von Maltzahn, G.</author><author>Park, J.

Inspired by the ability of communication to improve targeting in biological systems, such as inflammatory-cell recruitment to sites of disease, we construct systems where synthetic biological and nanotechnological components communicate to amplify disease targeting in vivo. These systems are composed of &apos;signalling&apos; modules (nanoparticles or engineered proteins) that target tumours and then locally activate the coagulation cascade to broadcast tumour location to clot-targeted &apos;receiving&apos; nanoparticles in circulation that carry a diagnostic or therapeutic cargo, thereby amplifying their delivery. We show that communicating nanoparticle systems can be composed of multiple types of signalling and receiving modules, can transmit information through multiple molecular pathways in coagulation, can operate autonomously and can target over 40 times higher doses of chemotherapeutics to tumours than non-communicating controls.</abstract><notes>von Maltzahn, Geoffrey; Park, Ji-Ho; Lin, Kevin Y; Singh, Neetu; Schwoppe, Christian; Mesters, Rolf; Berdel, Wolfgang E; Ruoslahti, Erkki; Sailor, Michael J; Bhatia, Sangeeta N; 5 P30 CA30199-28/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; 5-R01-CA124427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA124427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA 119335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Howard Hughes Medical Institute/; England; Nat Mater. 2011 Jun 19;10(7):545-52. doi: 10.1038/nmat3049.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21685903</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3361766</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nmat3049</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>195</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">195</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vivero-Escoto, J.

In this paper multifunctional MSNs with cleavable Gd(III) chelates are synthesized and characterized, and their applicability as MRI contrast agents is demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The MSNs contain Gd(III) chelates that are covalently linked via a redox-responsive disulfide moiety. The MSNs are further functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and an anisamide ligand to improve their biocompatibility and target specificity. The effectiveness of MSNs as an MRI imaging contrast agent and their targeting ability are successfully demonstrated in vitro using human colon adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer cells. Finally, the capability of this platform as an in vivo MRI contrast agent is tested using a 3T scanner. The Gd(III) chelate was quickly cleaved by the blood pool thiols and eliminated through the renal excretion pathway. Further tuning of the Gd(III) chelate release kinetics is needed before the MSN system can be used as target-specific MRI contrast agents in vivo.</abstract><notes>Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany; Small. 2011 Nov 9. doi: 10.1002/smll.201100521.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22069305</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/smll.201100521</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>558</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">558</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vivas-Mejia, P.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed the mRNA levels of survivin splice variants in ovarian cancer cell lines and ovarian tumor samples. siRNAs targeting survivin were designed to silence all survivin splice variants (T-siRNA) or survivin 2B (2B-siRNA) in vitro and orthotopic murine models of ovarian cancer. The mechanism of cell death was studied in taxane-resistant ovarian cancer cells and in tumor sections obtained from different mouse tumors. RESULTS: Taxane-resistant ovarian cancer cells express higher survivin mRNA levels than their taxane-sensitive counterparts. Survivin 2B expression was significantly higher in taxane-resistant compared with -sensitive cells. Silencing survivin 2B induced growth inhibitory effects similar to silencing total survivin in vitro. In addition, survivin 2B-siRNA incorporated into DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) nanoliposomes resulted in significant reduction in tumor growth (P &lt; 0.05) in orthotopic murine models of ovarian cancer, and these effects were similar to T-siRNA-DOPC. The antitumor effects were further enhanced in combination with docetaxel chemotherapy (P &lt; 0.01). Finally, we found a significant association between survivin 2B expression and progression-free survival in 117 epithelial ovarian cancers obtained at primary debulking surgery. CONCLUSIONS: These data identify survivin 2B as an important target in ovarian cancer and provide a translational path forward for developing new therapies against this target.</abstract><notes>Vivas-Mejia, Pablo E; Rodriguez-Aguayo, Cristian; Han, Hee-Dong; Shahzad, Mian M K; Valiyeva, Fatma; Shibayama, Mineko; Chavez-Reyes, Arturo; Sood, Anil K; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; 109298/PHS HHS/; CA 110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P30 CA016672-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA109298-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA110793-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128797-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2 GM092599-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U54 CA096300-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA096300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Jun 1;17(11):3716-26.

This approach allows charged polymers (including single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA and RNA) to be analysed with subnanometre resolution and without the need for labels or amplification. Recent advances suggest that nanopore-based sensors could be competitive with other third-generation DNA sequencing technologies, and may be able to rapidly and reliably sequence the human genome for under $1,000.

In this paper, however, we show that it is sensitive to variations in the background signal when the signal of interest is weak. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm to analyze measured spectra in Raman spectroscopy. The method is a hybrid least squares and principal component analysis algorithm. It explicitly accounts for any variations expected in the reference spectra used in the signal decomposition. We compare the novel algorithm to the least squares method with a low-order polynomial residual model, and demonstrate the novel algorithm&apos;s superior performance by comparing quantitative error metrics.

A major challenge for the smooth translation of targeted NPs to the clinic has been developing methods for the prediction and optimization of the NP surface composition, especially when targeting ligands (TL) of different chemical properties are involved in the NP self-assembly process. Here we investigated the self-assembly and properties of two different targeted NPs decorated with two widely used TLs that have different water solubilities, and developed methods to characterize and optimize NP surface composition. We synthesized two different biofunctional polymers composed of poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-b-polyethyleneglycol-RGD (PLGA-PEG-RGD, high water solubility TL) and PLGA-PEG-Folate (low water solubility TL). Targeted NPs with different ligand densities were prepared by mixing TL-conjugated polymers with non-conjugated PLGA-PEG at different ratios through nanoprecipitation. The NP surface composition was quantified and the results revealed two distinct nanoparticle assembly behaviors: for the case of PLGA-PEG-RGD, nearly all RGD molecules conjugated to the polymer were found to be on the surface of the NPs. In contrast, only approximately 20% of the folate from PLGA-PEG-Folate was present on the NP surface while the rest remained presumably buried in the PLGA NP core due to hydrophobic interactions of PLGA and folate. Finally, in vitro phagocytosis and cell targeting of NPs were investigated, from which a window of NP formulations exhibiting minimum uptake by macrophages and maximum uptake by targeted cells was determined. These results underscore the impact that the ligand chemical properties have on the targeting capabilities of self-assembled targeted nanoparticles and provide an engineering strategy for improving their targeting specificity.</abstract><notes>Valencia, Pedro M; Hanewich-Hollatz, Mikhail H; Gao, Weiwei; Karim, Fawziya; Langer, Robert; Karnik, Rohit; Farokhzad, Omid C; HHSN268201000045C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; HHSN268201000045C/PHS HHS/; U54 CA151884-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54-CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Biomaterials. 2011 Sep;32(26):6226-33.

The ability to rapidly quantitate drug response in cells harvested from patients in a point-of-care setting would have far reaching implications. Capitalizing on recent developments with miniaturized NMR technologies, we have developed a magnetic nanoparticle-based approach to directly measure both target expression and drug binding in scant human cells. The method involves covalent conjugation of the small-molecule drug to a magnetic nanoparticle that is then used as a read-out for target expression and drug-binding affinity. Using poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition as a model system, we developed an approach to distinguish differential expression of PARP in scant cells with excellent correlation to gold standards, the ability to mimic drug pharmacodynamics ex vivo through competitive target-drug binding, and the potential to perform such measurements in clinical samples.</abstract><notes>Ullal, Adeeti V; Reiner, Thomas; Yang, Katherine S; Gorbatov, Rostic; Min, Changwook; Issadore, David; Lee, Hakho; Weissleder, Ralph; HHSN268201000044C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; P50 CA086355-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50CA86355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626-07/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626-08/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB010011-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01-EB0044626/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01-EB010011/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; U54 CA151884-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2011 Nov 22;5(11):9216-24.

After spinal cord injury, the blood brain barrier is compromised, opening the way for chemokine signaling between these two systems. These experiments clarified prior contradictory findings on normal expression of SDF1 and CXCR4 as well as examined the resulting spinal cord responses resulting from this signaling. METHODS: These experiments examined the expression and function of SDF1 and CXCR4 in the normal and injured adult mouse spinal cord primarily using CXCR4-EGFP and SDF1-EGFP transgenic reporter mice. RESULTS: In the uninjured spinal cord, SDF1 was expressed in the dorsal corticospinal tract (dCST) as well as the meninges, whereas CXCR4 was found only in ependymal cells surrounding the central canal. After spinal cord injury (SCI), the pattern of SDF1 expression did not change rostral to the lesion but it disappeared from the degenerating dCST caudally. By contrast, CXCR4 expression changed dramatically after SCI. In addition to the CXCR4+ cells in the ependymal layer, numerous CXCR4+ cells appeared in the peripheral white matter and in the dorsal white matter localized between the dorsal corticospinal tract and the gray matter rostral to the lesion site. The non-ependymal CXCR4+ cells were found to be NG2+ and CD11b+ macrophages that presumably infiltrated through the broken blood-brain barrier. One population of macrophages appeared to be migrating towards the dCST that contains SDF1 rostral to the injury but not towards the caudal dCST in which SDF1 is no longer present. A second population of the CXCR4+ macrophages was present near the SDF1-expressing meningeal cells. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that attraction of CXCR4+ macrophages is part of a programmed response to injury and that modulation of the SDF1 signaling system may be important for regulating the inflammatory response after SCI.</abstract><notes>Tysseling, Vicki M&#xD;Mithal, Divakar&#xD;Sahni, Vibhu&#xD;Birch, Derin&#xD;Jung, Hosung&#xD;Belmadani, Abdelhak&#xD;Miller, Richard J&#xD;Kessler, John A&#xD;NS 20013/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;NS 20778/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 NS020013-27/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 NS020778/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 NS020778-26/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;J Neuroinflammation. 2011 Feb 16;8:16. doi: 10.1186/1742-2094-8-16.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21324162</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3050722</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1742-2094-8-16</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>645</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">645</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tsutsui, H.</author><author>Valamehr, B.</author><author>Hindoyan, A.</author><author>Qiao, R.</author><author>Ding, X.</author><author>Guo, S.</author><author>Witte, O.

However, the hydrophobicity and toxicity associated with fullerene limits its application as a therapeutic antioxidant. In the present study, we sought to overcome these limitations by generating water-soluble nanoformulations of fullerene (C(60)). Fullerene (C(60)) was formulated with poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidine) (PVP) or poly(2-alkyl-2-oxazoline)s (POx) homopolymer and random copolymer to form nano-complexes. These C(60)-polymer complexes were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy (IR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cellular uptake and intracellular distribution of the selected formulations in catecholaminergic (CATH.a) neurons were examined by UV-vis spectroscopy, immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to determine the ability of these C(60)-polymer complexes to scavenge superoxide. Their cytotoxicity was evaluated in three different cell lines. C(60)-POx and C(60)-PVP complexes exhibited similar physicochemical properties and antioxidant activities. C(60)-poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx) complex, but not C(60)-PVP complex, were efficiently taken up by CATH.a neurons and attenuated the increase in intra-neuronal superoxide induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulation. These results show that C(60)-POx complexes are non-toxic, neuronal cell permeable, superoxide scavenging antioxidants that might be promising candidates for the treatment of brain-related diseases associated with increased levels of superoxide.</abstract><notes>Tong, Jing; Zimmerman, Matthew C; Li, Shumin; Yi, Xiang; Luxenhofer, Robert; Jordan, Rainer; Kabanov, Alexander V; P20 RR021937-01A2/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; P20 RR021937-02/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; P20 RR021937-03/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; P20 RR021937-04/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; RR021937/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; England; Biomaterials. 2011 May;32(14):3654-65.

Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is a particularly aggressive molecular subtype defined by a robust cluster of genes expressed by epithelial cells in the basal or outer layer of the adult mammary gland. BLBC is a major clinical challenge because these tumors are prevalent in young woman, often relapsing rapidly. Additionally, most (but not all) basal-like tumors lack expression of steroid hormone receptors (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, limiting targeted therapeutic options for these predominantly triple-negative breast cancers. This minireview will focus on new insights into the molecular etiology of these poor-prognosis tumors that underlie their intrinsic genomic instability, deregulated cell proliferation and apoptosis, and invasive tumor biology. We will also review ongoing efforts to translate these fundamental insights into improved therapies for women with BLBC.</abstract><notes>Toft, Daniel J; Cryns, Vincent L; T32DK007169/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; Baltimore, Md.; Mol Endocrinol. 2011 Feb;25(2):199-211.

These approaches, however, are generally unable to quantify the level of expression of imaging probe reporters. In this study a novel method of quantification is presented using dual-probe fluorescence imaging, where an endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) fluorescent probe was paired with a non-targeted probe before being injected, and tracer kinetic compartmental modeling was used to determine EGFR expression in a region of interest from the uptake curves of the two drugs in that region. The approach was tested out in a simulation experiment and then applied in an in vivo study in one mouse to investigate EGFR expression in various tissue types (pancreas, pancreas tumor, and leg). The binding potentials (a unitless correlate of target availability) of EGFR expression in the various tissue types were 8.57, 25.64, and 0.11 for the pancreas, pancreas tumor, respectively. For the pancreas and leg, these results correlate well with expected levels of EGFR expression, with the pancreas demonstrating a much higher expression than the skin and also as expected, the tumor expressed much more EGFR than either healthy tissue.</abstract><notes>10.1117/12.891720</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.891720</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.891720</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1066</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1066</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thomas, S.</author><author>Waterman, P.</author><author>Chen, S.</author><author>Marinelli, B.</author><author>Seaman, M.</author><author>Rodig, S.</author><author>Ross, R.

There is a clinical need to determine the metastatic potential of the primary tumor to design the most appropriate treatment plan ranging from watchful waiting to more aggressive, invasive surgical treatments. In this study we have developed a nanoparticle based imaging agent that targets SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic Rich in Cysteine), a molecular marker of prostate cancer metastatic potential. Previous studies by this group used phage display to identify a peptide with high binding affinity and specificity for SPARC. In this study, the SPARC-targeted peptide sequence was used to design a biomaterial with improved pharmacokinetic properties by attaching it to a biocompatible nanoparticle that is also coupled to a fluorophore for in vivo imaging. Prostate cancer cell lines with varying degrees of SPARC expression were used to show the ability of the targeted nanoparticle to bind specifically to SPARC in vitro and in vivo including the clinically relevant bone and lung metastases. We show that in vivo imaging information correlates with the metastatic potential of the prostate tumor. This prognostic information could enable doctors to stratify patients and design personalized treatment strategies.</abstract><notes>Thomas, Stephanie; Waterman, Peter; Chen, Suelin; Marinelli, Brett; Seaman, Marc; Rodig, Scott; Ross, Robert W; Josephson, Lee; Weissleder, Ralph; Kelly, Kimberly A; R01 CA137071-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 EB010023-01A1/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; J Nanomed Nanotechnol. 2011 Aug;2(112). pii: 2157-7439-2-112.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22319675</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3273319</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.4172/2157-7439.1000112</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>162</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">162</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thomas, D.

These data are large in volume, diverse in content, and are beset with gaps and ambiguities in the description and characterization of nanomaterials. In this work, we have reviewed three areas of nanomedicine informatics: information resources; taxonomies, controlled vocabularies, and ontologies; and information standards. Informatics methods and standards in each of these areas are critical for enabling collaboration; data sharing; unambiguous representation and interpretation of data; semantic (meaningful) search and integration of data; and for ensuring data quality, reliability, and reproducibility. In particular, we have considered four types of information standards in this article, which are standard characterization protocols, common terminology standards, minimum information standards, and standard data communication (exchange) formats. Currently, because of gaps and ambiguities in the data, it is also difficult to apply computational methods and machine learning techniques to analyze, interpret, and recognize patterns in data that are high dimensional in nature, and also to relate variations in nanomaterial properties to variations in their chemical composition, synthesis, characterization protocols, and so on. Progress toward resolving the issues of information management in nanomedicine using informatics methods and standards discussed in this article will be essential to the rapidly growing field of nanomedicine informatics.

PEG-R-AuNPs have been shown preclinically to increase the sensitivity and specificity of Raman spectroscopy, with picomolar sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities. Although clinical trials are being designed to use functionalized PEG-R-AuNPs in various applications (e.g., to target dysplastic bowel lesions during colonoscopy), the effects of these nanoparticles on human cells remain unknown. The occurrence and mechanisms underlying any potential cytotoxicity induced by these nanoparticles (0-1000 PEG-R-AuNPs/cell) are investigated in immortalized human HeLa and HepG2 cell lines at several time points (0-48 h) after exposure. Using fluorometric assays, cell viability (MTT), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (dichlorofluorescein diacetate), protein oxidation (protein carbonyl content), and total cellular antioxidant concentrations the concentrations (metmyoblobin-induced oxidation of ABTS) are assessed. Analysis of lipid oxidation using an enzyme immunoassay (8-isoprostane concentrations), gene expression of antioxidant enzymes using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions, and the intracellular location of PEG-R-AuNPs using transmission electron microscopy is also undertaken. PEG-R-AuNPs cause no cytotoxicity in either HeLa or HepG2 cells in the acute setting as ROS generation is balanced by antioxidant enzyme upregulation. Following prolonged exposures (48 h) at relatively high concentrations (1000 PEG-R-AuNPs/cell), nanoparticles are found within vesicles inside cells. Under these conditions, a minimal amount of cytotoxicity is seen in both cell lines owing to increases in cellular oxidative stress, most likely due to ROS overwhelming the antioxidant defenses. Evidence of oxidative stress-induced damage includes increased lipid and protein oxidation. Although further in vivo toxicity studies are necessary, these initial encouraging results show that PEG-R-AuNPs cause minimal toxicity in human cells in the acute setting, which bodes well for potential future applications of these nanoparticles in living subjects.</abstract><notes>Thakor, Avnesh S&#xD;Paulmurugan, Ramasamy&#xD;Kempen, Paul&#xD;Zavaleta, Cristina&#xD;Sinclair, Robert&#xD;Massoud, Tarik F&#xD;Gambhir, Sanjiv S&#xD;P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Germany&#xD;Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany&#xD;Small. 2011 Jan 3;7(1):126-36.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21104804</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/smll.201001466</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1241</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1241</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thakor, A.

Although Raman spectroscopy is widely used for chemical and molecular analysis, its clinical application has been hindered by the inherently weak nature of the Raman effect. Raman-silica-gold-nanoparticles (R-Si-Au-NPs) overcome this limitation by producing larger Raman signals through surface-enhanced Raman scattering.

After intravenous administration, PEG-R-Si-Au-NPs were removed from the circulation by macrophages in the liver and spleen (that is, the reticuloendothelial system). At 24 hours, PEG-R-Si-Au-NPs elicited a mild inflammatory response and an increase in oxidative stress in the liver, which subsided by 2 weeks after administration. No evidence of significant toxicity was observed by measuring clinical, histological, biochemical, or cardiovascular parameters for 2 weeks. Because we are designing targeted PEG-R-Si-Au-NPs (for example, PEG-R-Si-Au-NPs labeled with an affibody that binds specifically to the epidermal growth factor receptor) to detect colorectal cancer after administration into the bowel lumen, we tested the toxicity of the core nanoparticle after administration per rectum. We observed no significant bowel or systemic toxicity, and no PEG-R-Si-Au-NPs were detected systemically. Although additional studies are required to investigate the long-term effects of PEG-R-Si-Au-NPs and their toxicity when carrying the targeting moiety, the results presented here support the idea that PEG-R-Si-Au-NPs can be safely used in living subjects, especially when administered rectally.</abstract><notes>Thakor, Avnesh S&#xD;Luong, Richard&#xD;Paulmurugan, Ramasamy&#xD;Lin, Frank I&#xD;Kempen, Paul&#xD;Zavaleta, Cristina&#xD;Chu, Pauline&#xD;Massoud, Tarik F&#xD;Sinclair, Robert&#xD;Gambhir, Sanjiv S&#xD;P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Sci Transl Med. 2011 Apr 20;3(79):79ra33.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21508310</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/scitranslmed.3001963</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>429</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">429</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thakor, A.

Although the use of gold has been largely superseded by newer drugs, gold nanoparticles are being used effectively in laboratory based clinical diagnostic methods while concurrently showing great promise in vivo either as a diagnostic imaging agent or a therapeutic agent. For these reasons, gold nanoparticles are therefore well placed to enter mainstream clinical practice in the near future. Hence, the present review summarizes the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, metabolism, and toxicity of bulk gold in humans based on decades of clinical observation and experiments in which gold was used to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The beneficial attributes of gold nanoparticles, such as their ease of synthesis, functionalization, and shape control are also highlighted demonstrating why gold nanoparticles are an attractive target for further development and optimization. The importance of controlling the size and shape of gold nanoparticles to minimize any potential toxic side effects is also discussed.</abstract><notes>Thakor, A S&#xD;Jokerst, J&#xD;Zavaleta, C&#xD;Massoud, T F&#xD;Gambhir, S S&#xD;P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA114747-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA114747-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA114747-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA114747-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA114747-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA114747-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA136465-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Nano Lett. 2011 Oct 12;11(10):4029-36. doi: 10.1021/nl202559p.

Still, there is a great deal of room for improvement, and nanoparticles with increased MRI relaxivities are needed to increase the contrast enhancement in MRI applied to various medical conditions including cancer. We report the synthesis of superparamagnetic iron platinum nanoparticles (SIPPs) and subsequent encapsulation using PEGylated phospholipids to create stealth immunomicelles (DSPE-SIPPs) that can be specifically targeted to human prostate cancer cell lines and detected using both MRI and fluorescence imaging. SIPP cores and DSPE-SIPPs were 8.5 +/- 1.6 nm and 42.9 +/- 8.2 nm in diameter, respectively, and the SIPPs had a magnetic moment of 120 A m(2)/kg iron. J591, a monoclonal antibody against prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), was conjugated to the DSPE-SIPPs (J591-DSPE-SIPPs), and specific targeting of J591-DSPE-SIPPs to PSMA-expressing human prostate cancer cell lines was demonstrated using fluorescence confocal microscopy. The transverse relaxivity of the DSPE-SIPPs, measured at 4.7 Tesla, was 300.6 +/- 8.5 s(-1) mM(-1), which is 13-fold better than commercially available SPIONs (23.8 +/- 6.9 s(-1) mM(-1)) and ~3-fold better than reported relaxivities for Feridex((R)) and Resovist((R)). Our data suggest that J591-DSPE-SIPPs specifically target human prostate cancer cells in vitro, are superior contrast agents in T(2)-weighted MRI, and can be detected using fluorescence imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the synthesis of multifunctional SIPP micelles and using SIPPs for the specific detection of prostate cancer.</abstract><notes>R01 CA123194-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Nanopart Res. 2011 Oct 1;13(10):4717-4729.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22121333</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3223933</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11051-011-0439-3</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1312</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1312</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tate, J.

The success of such nanoparticles as a therapeutic for diseases like cancer, however, depends heavily on the particles&apos; ability to localize to tumor tissue as well as provide minimal toxicity to surrounding tissues and key organs such as those involved in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). We present here the results of a long term clearance study where mice injected intravenously with 2 mg Fe of 100 nm dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were sacrificed at 14 and 580 days post injection. Histological analysis showed accumulation of the nanoparticles in some RES organs by the 14 day time point and clearance of the nanoparticles by the 580 day time point with no obvious toxicity to organs. An additional study reported herein employs 20 nm and 110 nm starch-coated iron oxide nanoparticles at 80 mg Fe/kg mouse in a size/biodistribution study with endpoints at 4, 24 and 72 hours. Preliminary results show nanoparticle accumulation in the liver and spleen with some elevated iron accumulation in tumoral tissues with differences between the 20 nm and the 110 nm nanoparticle depositions.</abstract><notes>10.1117/12.876414</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.876414</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.876414</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>785</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">785</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tassa, C.</author><author>Shaw, S.

This approach envisions risk stratification and therapeutic selection based on an individual&apos;s genetic makeup and physiologic state (the latter assessed through cellular or molecular phenotypes). Molecularly targeted nanoparticles can play a key role in this vision through noninvasive assessments of molecular processes and specific cell populations in vivo, sensitive molecular diagnostics, and targeted delivery of therapeutics. A superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle with a cross-linked dextran coating, or CLIO, is a powerful and illustrative nanoparticle platform for these applications. These structures and their derivatives support diagnostic imaging by magnetic resonance (MRI), optical, and positron emission tomography (PET) modalities and constitute a versatile platform for conjugation to targeting ligands. A variety of conjugation methods exist to couple the dextran surface to different functional groups; in addition, a robust bioorthogonal [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between 1,2,4,5-tetrazene (Tz) and trans-cyclooctene (TCO) can conjugate nanoparticles to targeting ligands or label pretargeted cells. The ready availability of conjugation methods has given rise to the synthesis of libraries of small molecule modified nanoparticles, which can then be screened for nanoparticles with specificity for a specific cell type. Since most nanoparticles display their targeting ligands in a multivalent manner, a detailed understanding of the kinetics and affinity of a nanoparticle&apos;s interaction with its target (as determined by surface plasmon resonance) can yield functionally important insights into nanoparticle design. In this Account, we review applications of the CLIO platform in several areas relevant to the mission of personalized medicine. We demonstrate rapid and highly sensitive molecular profiling of cancer markers ex vivo, as part of detailed, individualized molecular phenotyping. The CLIO platform also facilitates targeted magnetic resonance and combined modality imaging (such as MR/PET/fluorescence/CT) to enable multiplexed measurement of molecular phenotypes in vivo for early diagnosis and disease classification. Finally, the targeted delivery of a photodynamic therapy agent as part of a theranostic nanoparticle successfully increased local cell toxicity and minimized systemic side effects.</abstract><notes>Tassa, Carlos; Shaw, Stanley Y; Weissleder, Ralph; HHSN268201000044C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; HHSN268201000044C/PHS HHS/; R01 EB004626-08/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB010011-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Acc Chem Res. 2011 Oct 18;44(10):842-52.

We recently developed a multistage vector delivery system comprising biodegradable and biocompatible nanoporous silicon particles (first-stage microparticles [S1MPs]) able to host, protect, and deliver second-stage therapeutic and diagnostic nanoparticles (S2NPs) on intravenous injection. This delivery system aims at sequentially overcoming the biologic barriers en route to the target delivery site by separating and assigning tasks to the coordinated logic-embedded vectors constituting it. In this work, by conjugating a near-infrared dye on the surface of the S1MP without compromising the porous structure and potential loading of S2NPs, we were able to monitor the in vivo distribution of S1MPs in healthy mice using an optical imaging system. It was observed that particles predominantly accumulated in the liver and spleen at the end of 24 hours. Further quantification of S1MPs in the major organs of the animals by elemental analysis of silicon using inductively coupled plasma-atomic electron spectroscopy verified the accuracy of in vivo near-infrared imaging as a tool for evaluation of nanovector biodistribution.</abstract><notes>Tasciotti, Ennio; Godin, Biana; Martinez, Jonathan O; Chiappini, Ciro; Bhavane, Rohan; Liu, Xuewu; Ferrari, Mauro; R01 CA128797-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R33 CA122864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R33 CA122864-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; TL1 RR024147-05/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; TL1RR024147/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; U54 CA143837-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Mol Imaging. 2011 Feb;10(1):56-68.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21303615</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3088648</custom2><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>668</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">668</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tanaka, K.</author><author>Babic, I.</author><author>Nathanson, D.</author><author>Akhavan, D.</author><author>Guo, D.</author><author>Gini, B. </author><author>Dang, J.</author><author>Zhu, S.</author><author>Yang, H.</author><author>De Jesus, J.</author><author>Amzajerdi, A.

Through an integrated analysis of cell lines, in vivo models, and clinical samples, we demonstrate that mTORC2 is frequently activated in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain tumor of adults. We show that the common activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (EGFRvIII) stimulates mTORC2 kinase activity, which is partially suppressed by PTEN. mTORC2 signaling promotes GBM growth and survival and activates NF-kappaB. Importantly, this mTORC2-NF-kappaB pathway renders GBM cells and tumors resistant to chemotherapy in a manner independent of Akt. These results highlight the critical role of mTORC2 in the pathogenesis of GBM, including through the activation of NF-kappaB downstream of mutant EGFR, leading to a previously unrecognized function in cancer chemotherapy resistance. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting mTORC2, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, will be effective in the treatment of cancer.</abstract><notes>R01 CA075080-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 NS073831-01A1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS073831-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; Cancer Discov. 2011 Nov;1(6):524-538.

While increased secretion of proteases, which facilitates degradation of the basement membrane, and alterations in the cytoskeletal architecture of cancer cells have been previously studied, the contribution of the mechanical properties of cells in invasion is unclear. Here, we applied a magnetic tweezer system to establish that stiffness of patient tumor cells and cancer cell lines inversely correlates with migration and invasion through three-dimensional basement membranes, a correlation known as a power law. We found that cancer cells with the highest migratory and invasive potential are five times less stiff than cells with the lowest migration and invasion potential. Moreover, decreasing cell stiffness by pharmacologic inhibition of myosin II increases invasiveness, whereas increasing cell stiffness by restoring expression of the metastasis suppressor TbetaRIII/betaglycan decreases invasiveness. These findings are the first demonstration of the power-law relation between the stiffness and the invasiveness of cancer cells and show that mechanical phenotypes can be used to grade the metastatic potential of cell populations with the potential for single cell grading. The measurement of a mechanical phenotype, taking minutes rather than hours needed for invasion assays, is promising as a quantitative diagnostic method and as a discovery tool for therapeutics. By showing that altering stiffness predictably alters invasiveness, our results indicate that pathways regulating these mechanical phenotypes are novel targets for molecular therapy of cancer.</abstract><notes>Swaminathan, Vinay; Mythreye, Karthikeyan; O&apos;Brien, E Tim; Berchuck, Andrew; Blobe, Gerard C; Superfine, Richard; R01 CA135006-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA136786-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01-CA135006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151652-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54-CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Res. 2011 Aug 1;71(15):5075-80.

Novel approaches have been sought but with limited results. Nanomedicine offers solutions in diverse areas of sarcoma therapy including diagnosis and treatment. Several varieties of nanoparticles, including multifunctional nanoparticles, are available that localize the biodistribution of conventional chemotherapeutics to the tumor site. Also, nanoparticles loaded with chemotherapeutic drugs have the ability to overcome drug resistance which is a major obstacle impeding the progress of the treatment. Multifunctional nanoparticles, which have the potential to further augment the bioavailability of drugs, are being actively investigated. In this review, we will discuss the application of nanoparticles for improving the treatment of sarcoma patients.</abstract><notes>Susa, Michiro; Milane, Lara; Amiji, Mansoor M; Hornicek, Francis J; Duan, Zhenfeng; R01-CA119617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Pharm Res. 2011 Feb;28(2):260-72.

While receptor status is currently determined by immunohistochemistry assays, the development of noninvasive PR imaging agents could improve molecular characterization, treatment decisions, and disease monitoring. ProGlo, a progesterone-conjugated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent, was evaluated in vivo to determine whether it targets and enhances signal intensity in organs and tumors that express high PR levels. A tissue distribution study indicated that ProGlo accumulates in the PR-rich uterus, which was confirmed by in vivo imaging studies. Ex vivo images of these organs revealed that ProGlo was distributed in the substructures that express high PR levels. In xenograft tumor models, ProGlo was taken up to a greater extent than the nonfunctionalized Gd-DO3A in tumors, particularly in PR(+) tumors. The ability to accumulate and enhance signal intensity in PR(+) organs and tumors suggests that ProGlo may be a promising MRI probe for PR(+) diseases.</abstract><notes>Sukerkar, Preeti A&#xD;MacRenaris, Keith W&#xD;Meade, Thomas J&#xD;Burdette, Joanna E&#xD;1S10RR025624-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/&#xD;P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB005866-07/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01EB005866/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 CA143331-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R21CA143331/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Mol Pharm. 2011 Aug 1;8(4):1390-400.

Our strategy is based on facile conjugation of BTZ to catechol-containing polymeric carriers that are designed to be taken up selectively by cancer cells through cell surface receptor-mediated mechanisms. The polymer used as a building block in this study was poly(ethylene glycol), which was chosen for its ability to reduce nonspecific interactions with proteins and cells. The catechol moiety was exploited for its ability to bind and release borate-containing therapeutics such as BTZ in a pH-dependent manner. In acidic environments, such as in cancer tissue or the subcellular endosome, BTZ dissociates from the polymer-bound catechol groups to liberate the free drug, which inhibits proteasome function. A cancer-cell-targeting ligand, biotin, was presented on the polymer carriers to facilitate targeted entry of drug-loaded polymer carriers into cancer cells. Our study demonstrated that the cancer-targeting drug-polymer conjugates dramatically enhanced cellular uptake, proteasome inhibition, and cytotoxicity toward breast carcinoma cells in comparison with nontargeting drug-polymer conjugates. The pH-sensitive catechol-boronate binding mechanism provides a chemoselective approach for controlling the release of BTZ in targeted cancer cells, establishing a concept that may be applied in the future toward other boronic acid-containing therapeutics to treat a broad range of diseases.</abstract><notes>Su, Jing; Chen, Feng; Cryns, Vincent L; Messersmith, Phillip B; DE014193/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/; J Am Chem Soc. 2011 Aug 10;133(31):11850-3.

Drawbacks include low signal sensitivity, fast clearance, and nonspecificity that limit efficacy in experimental imaging. In order to create a bioresponsive MR contrast agent, a series of four Gd(III) complexes targeted to the HaloTag reporter were designed and synthesized. HaloTag is unique among reporter proteins for its specificity, versatility, and the covalent interaction between substrate and protein. In similar systems, these properties produce prolonged in vivo lifetimes and extended imaging opportunities for contrast agents, longer rotational correlation times, and increases in relaxivity (r(1)) upon binding to the HaloTag protein. In this work we report a new MR contrast probe, 2CHTGd, which forms a covalent bond with its target protein and results in a dramatic increase in sensitivity. A 6-fold increase in r(1), from 3.8 to 22 mM(-1) s(-1), is observed upon 2CHTGd binding to the target protein. This probe was designed for use with the HaloTag protein system which allows for a variety of substrates (specific for MRI, florescence, or protein purification applications) to be used with the same reporter.</abstract><notes>Strauch, Renee C&#xD;Mastarone, Daniel J&#xD;Sukerkar, Preeti A&#xD;Song, Ying&#xD;Ipsaro, Jonathan J&#xD;Meade, Thomas J&#xD;R01 EB005866/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB005866-07/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;J Am Chem Soc. 2011 Oct 19;133(41):16346-9. doi: 10.1021/ja206134b.

Glioblastoma mutliforme (GBM), the most aggressive of these neoplasms, are generally lethal within 2 years of diagnosis due in part to the intense apoptosis resistance of its cancer cells, hence poor therapeutic response to conventional and targeted therapies. Twenty years of research has uncovered key genetic events involved in disease initiation and progression, foremost the Tp53 tumor suppressor that is mutated or deleted in 35% of GBM. The prime importance of p53 signaling for gliomapathogenesis is further evidenced by epistatic genetic events targeting additional pathway components including deletion of p14 (Arf) (CDKN2A) and amplification of the p53-degrading ubiquitin ligases MDM2 and MDM4. Recent studies have identified and validated Bcl2-Like 12 (Bcl2L12) as a potent glioma oncoprotein with multiple strategic points in apoptosis regulatory networks, i.e. effector caspases and the p53 tumor suppressor. Bcl2L12 resides in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the cytoplasm, Bcl2L12 functions to inhibit caspases 3 and 7, in the nucleus, Bcl2L12 forms a complex with p53, modestly reduces p53 protein stability and prevents its binding to selected target gene promoter (e.g. p21, DR5, Noxa and PUMA), thereby inhibiting p53-directed transcriptomic changes upon DNA damage. Proteomic and multidimensional oncogenomic analyses confirmed a Bcl2L12-p53 signaling axis in GBM, as Bcl2L12 exhibited predominant genomic amplification, elevated mRNA and protein levels in GBM tumors with uncompromised p53 function. On the cell biological level, Bcl2L12 exerts robust inhibition of p53-dependent senescence and apoptosis processes in glioma cells. These multi-leveled studies establish Bcl2L12 as an important oncoprotein acting at the intersection of nuclear p53 and cytoplasmic caspase signaling and point to pharmacological disruption of the Bcl2L12:p53 complex as a promising novel therapeutic strategy for the enhanced treatment of GBM.</abstract><notes>Journal article; Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.); Cell Cycle. 2011 Jan 1;10(1).</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21200141</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>14365 [pii]</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>552</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">552</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Steg, A.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We describe in vitro effects of targeting of Jagged1 on ovarian cancer cells and in vivo effects of independent targeting of stromal and malignant cell Jagged1 using species-specific human or murine siRNA constructs incorporated into chitosan nanoparticles and delivered intravenously in an orthotopic mouse model. RESULTS: Jagged1 expression was prominent in SKOV3ip1 and IGROV-AF1, and significantly overexpressed in SKOV3TRip2, a taxane-resistant SKOV3 subclone. Jagged1 silencing with siRNA decreased cell viability and reversed taxane chemoresistance. In two different orthotopic ovarian cancer models, treatment with anti-human Jagged1 siRNA-CH reduced growth by 54.4% to 58.3% and with anti-murine Jagged1 siRNA-CH reduced growth by 41.7% to 48.8%. The combination of both species-specific constructs reduced tumor weight by 87.5% to 93.1% and sensitized SKOV3TRip2 tumors to docetaxel in vivo. Tumors showed reduced microvessel density with anti-murine Jagged1 constructs and decreased proliferation with anti-human Jagged1 siRNAs-CH. In addition, we show that Jagged1 downregulation does not sensitize cells to taxanes through a reduction in MDR1 expression, but at least in part by cross-talk with the GLI2 mediator of the Hedgehog pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Jagged1 plays dual roles in cancer progression through an angiogenic function in tumor endothelial cells and through proliferation and chemoresistance in tumor cells. Dual inhibition represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for ovarian and potentially other malignancies.</abstract><notes>Steg, Adam D; Katre, Ashwini A; Goodman, Blake; Han, Hee-Dong; Nick, Alpa M; Stone, Rebecca L; Coleman, Robert L; Alvarez, Ronald D; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K; Landen, Charles N; CA10929801/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; L30 CA135771-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA109298-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Sep 1;17(17):5674-85.

Encapsulation by PA nanofibers was found to improve the aqueous solubility of the CPT molecule by more than 50-fold. PAs self-assembled into nanofibers in the presence of CPT as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy. Small-angle X-ray scattering results suggest a slight increase in diameter of the nanofiber to accommodate the hydrophobic cargo. In vitro studies using human breast cancer cells show an enhancement in antitumor activity of the CPT when encapsulated by the PA nanofibers. In addition, using a mouse orthotopic model of human breast cancer, treatment with PA nanofiber-encapsulated CPT inhibited tumor growth. These results highlight the potential of this model PA system to be adapted for delivery of hydrophobic therapies to treat a variety of diseases including cancer.</abstract><notes>Soukasene, Stephen&#xD;Toft, Daniel J&#xD;Moyer, Tyson J&#xD;Lu, Hsuming&#xD;Lee, Hyung-Kun&#xD;Standley, Stephany M&#xD;Cryns, Vincent L&#xD;Stupp, Samuel I&#xD;1U54CA119341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;5F32GM080021/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;T32DK0-07169/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119341-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;ACS Nano. 2011 Nov 22;5(11):9113-21.

Although the connections between stress and cancer causation are not strong, epidemiologic and clinical studies have provided strong links between cancer progression and several stress-related factors including chronic stress, depression, and social isolation. Recent molecular and biological studies have identified specific signaling pathways that influence cancer growth and metastasis. In particular, stress hormones can have a significant impact on protecting cancer cells from undergoing the anoikis form of programmed cell death, thus, providing a mechanistic advantage for metastasis. This review provides an overview of the relationship between psychosocial factors and the avoidance of anoikis by cancer cells.</abstract><notes>Sood, Anil K; Lutgendorf, Susan K; CA104825/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA140933/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA098258-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA104825-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA109298-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA110793-05S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128797-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA140933-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA140933-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2 GM092599-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Philadelphia, Pa.; Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2011 Apr;4(4):481-5.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.; Review</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21464029</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3074235</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-10-0358</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1290</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1290</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Somasunderam, A.</author><author>Gorenstein, D.

The main rationale is that cubic CdE and HgE have nearly identical lattice constants but very different band gap energies and electron/hole masses. Thus, replacement of Cd(2+) by Hg(2+) in CdTe nanocrystals does not change the particle size, but it greatly alters the band gap energy. After capping with a multilayer shell and solubilization with a multidentate ligand, this class of cation-exchanged QDs are compact (6.5 nm nanocrystal size and 10 nm hydrodynamic diameter) and very bright (60-80% quantum yield), with narrow and symmetric fluorescence spectra tunable across the wavelength range from 700 to 1150 nm.</abstract><notes>Smith, Andrew M; Nie, Shuming; 1K99CA154006-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; K99 CA153914/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; K99 CA153914-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; K99 CA153914-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; PN2 EY018244-07/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; PN2EY018244/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; R01 CA108468/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA108468-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119338-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA119338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Am Chem Soc. 2011 Jan 12;133(1):24-6.

Consequently, further investigations exploring additional therapeutic applications are warranted. Current limitations associated with the non-specific nature of intravenous drugs limit the potential of certain pharmacological agents. One such treatment that could benefit from a stable delivery platform is antibody (Ab) therapy. Determination of Ab adsorption and desorption to a ND surface was subsequently examined using the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) antibody as a model therapeutic. ND-Ab complexes were found to be stable in water through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), UV-vis spectroscopy and TEM, with no Ab released after ten days. Released Abs were detected in extreme pH solutions (3.5), DMEM (+) serum with pH levels ranging from 4 to 10.5, and inorganic saline solutions. Preserved activity of Abs released in DMEM (+) serum was confirmed using an ELISA. These results suggest ND-Ab complexes are synthesized and stabilized in water and are triggered to release active Abs upon exposure to physiological conditions.</abstract><notes>Smith, Adrienne H; Robinson, Erik M; Zhang, Xue-Qing; Chow, Edward K; Lin, Yang; Osawa, Eiji; Xi, Jianzhong; Ho, Dean; U54CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Nanoscale. 2011 Jul;3(7):2844-8.

The chromatographic separation of DM-PIT-1 was achieved on C18 column using isocratic elution with acetonitrile-water (70:30) containing 0.1% formic acid (v/v). DM-PIT-1 was detected by UV absorbance at 320 nm and confirmed by LC-MS. The extraction of the DM-PIT-1 from the plasma and tumor tissue with methylene chloride resulted in its high recovery (70-80%). HPLC calibration curves for DM-PIT-1 based on the extracts from the mouse plasma and tumor tissue samples were linear over a broad concentration range of 0.25-20 mug/ml/g, with intra/inter-day accuracy of 95% and the precision of variation below 10%. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.1 ng and 0.2 ng, respectively. The described method was successfully applied to study the pharmacokinetics of the DM-PIT-1 following the parenteral injections of DM-PIT-1 entrapped in 1,2-disteratoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene-glycol)- 2000] (PEG-PE) micelles.</abstract><notes>Skidan, Igor; Grunwald, Jacob; Thekkedath, Ritesh; Degterev, Alexei; Torchilin, Vladimir; U54 CA151881-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Netherlands; J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci. 2011 Jun 1;879(19):1610-6.

However, achieving triggered drug release from MSNPs in vivo has been challenging. Here, we describe the synthesis of stimulus-responsive polymer-coated MSNPs and the loading of therapeutics into both the core and shell domains. We characterize MSNP drug-eluting properties in vitro and demonstrate that the polymer-coated MSNPs release doxorubicin in response to proteases present at a tumor site in vivo, resulting in cellular apoptosis. These results demonstrate the utility of polymer-coated nanoparticles in specifically delivering an antitumor payload.</abstract><notes>Singh, Neetu; Karambelkar, Amrita; Gu, Luo; Lin, Kevin; Miller, Jordan S; Chen, Christopher S; Sailor, Michael J; Bhatia, Sangeeta N; R01 CA124427-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01-CA124427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119349-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54-CA119335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54-CA119349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Howard Hughes Medical Institute/; J Am Chem Soc. 2011 Dec 14;133(49):19582-5.

The conference was the first of its kind to bring together more than 30 invited speakers in the frontier of RNA nanotechnology from France, Sweden, South Korea, China, and throughout the United States to discuss RNA nanotechnology and its applications. It provided a platform for researchers from academia, government, and the pharmaceutical industry to share existing knowledge, vision, technology, and challenges in the field and promoted collaborations among researchers interested in advancing this emerging scientific discipline. The meeting covered a range of topics, including biophysical and single-molecule approaches for characterization of RNA nanostructures; structure studies on RNA nanoparticles by chemical or biochemical approaches, computation, prediction, and modeling of RNA nanoparticle structures; methods for the assembly of RNA nanoparticles; chemistry for RNA synthesis, conjugation, and labeling; and application of RNA nanoparticles in therapeutics. A special invited talk on the well-established principles of DNA nanotechnology was arranged to provide models for RNA nanotechnology. An Administrator from National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer discussed the current nanocancer research directions and future funding opportunities at NCI. As indicated by the feedback received from the invited speakers and the meeting participants, this meeting was extremely successful, exciting, and informative, covering many groundbreaking findings, pioneering ideas, and novel discoveries.</abstract><notes>Shukla, Girish C; Haque, Farzin; Tor, Yitzhak; Wilhelmsson, L Marcus; Toulme, Jean-Jacques; Isambert, Herve; Guo, Peixuan; Rossi, John J; Tenenbaum, Scott A; Shapiro, Bruce A; CA151648/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB003730/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; GM059944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; PN2 EY 018230/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2011 May 24;5(5):3405-18.</notes><work-type>Congresses; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21604810</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3102291</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/nn200989r</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>862</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">862</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shu, Y.</author><author>Cinier, M.</author><author>Shu, D.</author><author>Guo, P.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Nanobiomedical Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.</auth-address><titles><title>Assembly of multifunctional phi29 pRNA nanoparticles for specific delivery of siRNA and other therapeutics to targeted cells</title><secondary-title>Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Methods</full-title><abbr-1>Methods (San Diego, Calif</abbr-1></periodical><pages>204-14</pages><volume>54</volume><number>2</number><edition>2011/02/16</edition><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Aptamers, Nucleotide/*chemistry/genetics</keyword><keyword>Bacillus Phages/*genetics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Molecular Targeted Therapy</keyword><keyword>*Nanoparticles</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid Conformation</keyword><keyword>RNA, Small Interfering/*administration &amp; dosage/pharmacokinetics</keyword><keyword>RNA, Viral/*chemistry/genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>Jun</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1095-9130 (Electronic); 1046-2023 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>21320601</accession-num><abstract>Recent advances in RNA nanotechnology have led to the emergence of a new field and brought vitality to the area of therapeutics [P. Guo, The emerging field of RNA nanotechnology, Nat. Nanotechnol., 2010]. Due to the complementary nature of the four nucleotides and its special catalytic activity, RNA can be manipulated with simplicity characteristic of DNA, while possessing versatile structure and diverse function similar to proteins. Loops and tertiary architecture serve as mounting dovetails or wedges to eliminate external linking dowels. Unique features in transcription, termination, self-assembly, self-processing, and acid-resistance enable in vivo production of nanoparticles harboring aptamer, siRNA, ribozyme, riboswitch, or other regulators for therapy, detection, regulation, and intracellular computation. The unique property of noncanonical base-pairing and stacking enables RNA to fold into well-defined structures for constructing nanoparticles with special functionalities. Bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor is geared by a ring consisting of six packaging RNA (pRNA) molecules. pRNA is able to form a multimeric complex via the interaction of two reengineered interlocking loops. This unique feature makes it an ideal polyvalent vehicle for nanomachine fabrication, pathogen detection, and delivery of siRNA or other therapeutics. This review describes methods in using pRNA as a building block for the construction of RNA dimers, trimers, and hexamers as nanoparticles in medical applications. Methods for industrial-scale production of large and stable RNA nanoparticles will be introduced. The unique favorable PK (pharmacokinetics) profile with a half life (T(1/2)) of 5-10h comparing to 0.25 of conventional 2&apos;-F siRNA, and advantageous in vivo features such as non-toxicity, non-induction of interferons or non-stimulating of cytokine response in animals will also be reviewed.</abstract><notes>Shu, Yi; Cinier, Mathieu; Shu, Dan; Guo, Peixuan; CA151648/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB003730/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; GM059944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; PN2 EY018230-01/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; PN2 EY018230-02/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; PN2 EY018230-03/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; PN2 EY018230-04/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; R01 EB003730-05/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB003730-06/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB003730-07/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB012135-01A1/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 GM059944-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM059944-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM059944-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM059944-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM059944-04S1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM059944-05A2/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM059944-06/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM059944-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM059944-08/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM059944-09/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U01 CA151648-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 CA151648-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; San Diego, Calif.; Methods. 2011 Jun;54(2):204-14.

Currently, chemical synthesis of 117-nt RNA is not feasible commercially. In addition, labeling at specific locations on pRNA requires the understanding of its modular organization. Here, we report multiple approaches for the construction of a functional 117-base pRNA using two synthetic RNA fragments with variable modifications. The resulting bipartite pRNA was fully competent in associating with other interacting pRNAs to form dimers, as demonstrated by the packaging of DNA via the nanomotor and the assembly of phi29 viruses in vitro. The pRNA subunit assembled from bipartite fragments harboring siRNA or receptor-binding ligands were equally competent in assembling into dimers. The subunits carrying different functionalities were able to bind cancer cells specifically, enter the cell, and silence specific genes of interest. The pRNA nanoparticles were subsequently processed by Dicer to release the siRNA embedded within the nanoparticles. The results will pave the way toward the treatment of diseases using synthetic pRNA/siRNA chimeric nanoparticles.</abstract><notes>Shu, Yi; Cinier, Mathieu; Fox, Sejal R; Ben-Johnathan, Nira; Guo, Peixuan; CA151648/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB003730/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; GM059944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; Mol Ther. 2011 Jul;19(7):1304-11. doi: 10.1038/mt.2011.23.

The lack of covalent linkage or crosslinking in nanoparticles causes dissociation in vivo. Here we show that the packaging RNA of bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor can be assembled from 3-6 pieces of RNA oligomers without the use of metal salts. Each RNA oligomer contains a functional module that can be a receptor-binding ligand, aptamer, short interfering RNA or ribozyme. When mixed together, they self-assemble into thermodynamically stable tri-star nanoparticles with a three-way junction core. These nanoparticles are resistant to 8 M urea denaturation, are stable in serum and remain intact at extremely low concentrations. The modules remain functional in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the three-way junction core can be used as a platform for building a variety of multifunctional nanoparticles. We studied 25 different three-way junction motifs in biological RNA and found only one other motif that shares characteristics similar to the three-way junction of phi29 pRNA.</abstract><notes>Shu, Dan; Shu, Yi; Haque, Farzin; Abdelmawla, Sherine; Guo, Peixuan; CA151648/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB003730/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; GM059944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 EB003730-07/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB003730-09/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 GM059944-08/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM059944-09/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U01 CA151648-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Nat Nanotechnol. 2011 Sep 11;6(10):658-67. doi: 10.1038/nnano.2011.105.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21909084</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3189281</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nnano.2011.105</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>657</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">657</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shin, Y.

We assayed 12 proteins secreted from human macrophages that were subjected to lipopolysaccharide challenge, which emulates the macrophage-based innate immune responses against Gram-negative bacteria. We characterize the fluctuations in protein secretion of single cells, and of small cell colonies (n = 2, 3,...), as a function of colony size. Measuring the fluctuations permits a validation of the conditions required for the application of a quantitative version of the Le Chatelier&apos;s principle, as derived using information theory.

Although type I collagen functions as a barrier to invasion, pancreatic cancer cells have been shown to respond to type I collagen by becoming more motile and invasive. Because epithelial-mesenchymal transition is also associated with cancer invasion, we examined the extent to which collagen modulated the expression of Snail, a well known regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Relative to cells grown on tissue culture plastic, PDAC cells grown in three-dimensional collagen gels induced Snail. Inhibiting the activity or expression of the TGF-beta type I receptor abrogated collagen-induced Snail. Downstream of the receptor, we showed that Smad3 and Smad4 were critical for the induction of Snail by collagen. In contrast, Smad2 or ERK1/2 was not involved in collagen-mediated Snail expression. Overexpression of Snail in PDAC cells resulted in a robust membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14)-dependent invasion through collagen-coated transwell chambers. Snail-expressing PDAC cells also demonstrated MT1-MMP-dependent scattering in three-dimensional collagen gels. Mechanistically, Snail increased the expression of MT1-MMP through activation of ERK-MAPK signaling, and inhibiting ERK signaling in Snail-expressing cells blocked two-dimensional collagen invasion and attenuated scattering in three-dimensional collagen. To provide in vivo support for our findings that Snail can regulate MT1-MMP, we examined the expression of Snail and MT1-MMP in human PDAC tumors and found a statistically significant positive correlation between MT1-MMP and Snail in these tumors. Overall, our data demonstrate that pancreatic cancer cells increase Snail on encountering collagen-rich milieu and suggest that the desmoplastic reaction actively contributes to PDAC progression.</abstract><notes>Shields, Mario A&#xD;Dangi-Garimella, Surabhi&#xD;Krantz, Seth B&#xD;Bentrem, David J&#xD;Munshi, Hidayatullah G&#xD;R01CA126888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;J Biol Chem. 2011 Mar 25;286(12):10495-504.

The use of NPs for drug delivery and imaging has introduced exciting opportunities for the improvement of disease diagnosis and treatment. Over the past two decades, several first-generation therapeutic NP products have entered the market. Despite the lack of controlled release and molecular targeting properties in these products, they improved the therapeutic benefit of clinically validated drugs by enhancing drug tolerability and/or efficacy. NP-based imaging agents have also improved the sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic modalities. The introduction of controlled-release properties and targeting ligands toward the development of next-generation NPs should enable the development of safer and more effective therapeutic NPs and facilitate their application in theranostic nanomedicine. Targeted and controlled-release NPs can drastically alter the pharmacological characteristics of their payload, including their pharmacokinetic and, in some cases, their pharmacodynamic properties. As a result, these NPs can improve drug properties beyond what can be achieved through classic medicinal chemistry. Despite their enormous potential, the translation of targeted NPs into clinical development has faced considerable challenges. One significant problem has been the difficulty in developing targeted NPs with optimal biophysicochemical properties while using robust processes that facilitate scale-up and manufacturing. Recently, efforts have focused on developing NPs through self-assembly or high-throughput processes to facilitate the development and screening of NPs with these distinct properties and the subsequent scale-up of their manufacture. We have also undertaken parallel efforts to integrate additional functionality within therapeutic and imaging NPs, including the ability to carry more than one payload, to respond to environmental triggers, and to provide real-time feedback. In addition, novel targeting approaches are being developed to enhance the tissue-, cell-, or subcellular-specific delivery of NPs for a myriad of important diseases. These include the selection of internalizing ligands for enhanced receptor-mediated NP uptake and the development of extracellular targeting ligands for vascular tissue accumulation of NPs. In this Account, we primarily review the evolution of marketed NP technologies. We also recount our efforts in the design and optimization of NPs for medical applications, which formed the foundation for the clinical translation of the first-in-man targeted and controlled-release NPs (BIND-014) for cancer therapy.</abstract><notes>Shi, Jinjun; Xiao, Zeyu; Kamaly, Nazila; Farokhzad, Omid C; CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB003647/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; N01 HV-08236/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/; Acc Chem Res. 2011 Oct 18;44(10):1123-34.

However, efficient and biocompatible delivery methods are needed for systemic delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA). To maintain a high level of growth, tumor cells scavenge high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles by overexpressing its receptor: scavenger receptor type B1 (SR-B1). In this study, we exploited this cellular characteristic to achieve efficient siRNA delivery and established a novel formulation of siRNA by incorporating it into reconstituted HDL (rHDL) nanoparticles. Here, we demonstrate that rHDL nanoparticles facilitate highly efficient systemic delivery of siRNA in vivo, mediated by the SR-B1. Moreover, in therapeutic proof-of-concept studies, these nanoparticles were effective in silencing the expression of two proteins that are key to cancer growth and metastasis (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and focal adhesion kinase) in orthotopic mouse models of ovarian and colorectal cancer. These data indicate that an rHDL nanoparticle is a novel and highly efficient siRNA carrier, and therefore, this novel technology could serve as the foundation for new cancer therapeutic approaches.</abstract><notes>Shahzad, Mian M K; Mangala, Lingegowda S; Han, Hee Dong; Lu, Chunhua; Bottsford-Miller, Justin; Nishimura, Masato; Mora, Edna M; Lee, Jeong-Won; Stone, Rebecca L; Pecot, Chad V; Thanapprapasr, Duangmani; Roh, Ju-Won; Gaur, Puja; Nair, Maya P; Park, Yun-Yong; Sabnis, Nirupama; Deavers, Michael T; Lee, Ju-Seog; Ellis, Lee M; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; McConathy, Walter J; Prokai, Laszlo; Lacko, Andras G; Sood, Anil K; CA 009614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA 101642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; HD050128/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Canada; New York, N.Y.; Neoplasia. 2011 Apr;13(4):309-19.</notes><work-type>Evaluation Studies; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.; Validation Studies</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21472135</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3071079</custom2><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>781</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">781</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Settles, M.</author><author>Etzrodt, M.</author><author>Kosanke, K.</author><author>Schiemann, M.</author><author>Zimmermann, A.</author><author>Meier, R.</author><author>Braren, R.</author><author>Huber, A.</author><author>Rummeny, E.

METHODS: Human monocytes were labeled with four different magnetic nanoparticle preparations (Ferumoxides, SHU 555C, CLIO-680, MION-48) exhibiting distinct properties and cellular uptake was quantitatively assessed by flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, atomic absorption spectrometry and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Additionally we determined whether cellular uptake of the nanoparticles resulted in phenotypic changes of cell surface markers. RESULTS: Cellular uptake differed between the four nanoparticle preparations. However for each nanoparticle tested, CD14(+)(+)CD16(-) monocytes displayed a significantly higher uptake compared to CD14(+)CD16(+)(+) monocytes, this resulted in significantly lower T1 and T2 relaxation times of these cells. The uptake of iron-oxide nanoparticles further resulted in a remarkable shift of expression of cell surface proteins indicating that the labeling procedure affects the phenotype of CD14(+)CD16(+)(+) and CD14(+)(+)CD16(-) monocytes differently. CONCLUSION: Human monocyte subsets internalize different magnetic nanoparticle preparations differently, resulting in variable loading capacities, imaging phenotypes and likely biological properties.</abstract><notes>Settles, Marcus; Etzrodt, Martin; Kosanke, Katja; Schiemann, Matthias; Zimmermann, Alexander; Meier, Reinhard; Braren, Rickmer; Huber, Armin; Rummeny, Ernst J; Weissleder, Ralph; Swirski, Filip K; Wildgruber, Moritz; R01 HL095612-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25197.

Engineering of the MTM biosynthetic pathway has produced the 3-side-chain-modified analogs MTM SK (SK) and MTM SDK (SDK), which have exhibited increased anticancer activity and improved therapeutic index. However, these analogs still suffer from low bioavailability, short plasma retention time, and low tumor accumulation. In an effort to aid with these shortcomings, two nanoparticulate formulations, poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(aspartate hydrazide) self-assembled and cross-linked micelles, were investigated with regard to the ability to load and pH dependently release the drugs. Micelles were successfully formed with both nanoparticulate formulations of each drug analog, with an average size of 8.36 +/- 3.21 and 12.19 +/- 2.77 nm for the SK and SDK micelles and 29.56 +/- 4.67 nm and 30.48 +/- 7.00 nm for the SK and SDK cross-linked micelles respectively. All of the drug-loaded formulations showed a pH-dependent release of the drugs, which was accelerated as pH decreased from 7.4 to 5.0. The micelles retained biological activity of SK and SDK entrapped in the micelles, suppressing human A549 lung cancer cells effectively.</abstract><notes>Scott, Daniel; Rohr, Jurgen; Bae, Younsoo; 5R25CA153954/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA 091901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; New Zealand; Int J Nanomedicine. 2011;6:2757-67.

By combining optical and acoustic modalities, high-contrast, physiologicallyrelevant optical information at higher spatial resolutions can be achieved. Hybrid imaging modalities such as acoustooptic and photoacoustic imaging improve resolution over conventional optical imaging, but tissue scattering results in poor signal-to-background ratios especially in deeper tissues. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a novel microbubble (MB) contrast agent surface-loaded with a self-quenching fluorophore. In response to ultrasound, the MB expands and contracts, generating changes in fluorophore surface density. The changes in physical separation between fluorophores modulate the quenching efficiency and produce a fluorescence intensity modulation. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of ultrasound modulation of fluorescence using a self-quenching MB scheme. The modulation is spatially localized to the ultrasound focal zone where the pressure is greatest and the largest MB oscillations are induced. The modulated signal can be extracted from a large constant light background, increasing detection sensitivity. This technique can enable sensitive optical imaging with ultrasound-scale sub-millimeter spatial resolution, overcoming significant challenges of optical imaging in deep tissue. The contrast agent MBs were prepared with a shell of phospholipid and lipophilic self-quenching fluorophore. MB ultrasound response was studied in a custom setup which monitored fluorescence emitted from an insonified sample. Fluorescence signals displayed clearly modulated intensity and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) showed a strong component at the ultrasound driving frequency.</abstract><notes>10.1117/12.894056</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.894056</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.894056</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1227</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1227</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schultz-Sikma, E.

Many factors, including size, composition, atomic structure, and surface properties are crucial in the design of such nanoparticle-based probes due to their influence on the magnetic properties. Silica-coated iron oxide (IO-SiO(2)) and cobalt ferrite (CoIO-SiO(2)) nanoparticles were synthesized using standard high temperature thermal decomposition and base-catalyzed water-in-oil microemulsion techniques. Under neutral aqueous conditions, it was found that 50-75% of the cobalt content in the CoIO-SiO(2) nanoparticles leached out of the core structure. Leaching caused a 7.2-fold increase in longitudinal relaxivity and an increase in the saturation magnetization from ~48 emu/g core to ~65 emu/g core. X-ray absorption fine structure studies confirmed that the atomic structure of the ferrite core was altered following leaching, while TEM and DLS confirmed that the morphology and size of the nanoparticle remained unchanged. The CoIO-SiO(2) nanoparticles converted from a partially inverted spinel cation arrangement (unleached state) to an inverse spinel arrangement (leached state). The control IO-SiO(2) nanoparticles remained stable with no change in structure and negligible changes in magnetic behavior. This detailed analysis highlights how important understanding the properties of nanomaterials is in the development of reliable agents for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.</abstract><notes>Schultz-Sikma, Elise A&#xD;Joshi, Hrushikesh M&#xD;Ma, Qing&#xD;Macrenaris, Keith W&#xD;Eckermann, Amanda L&#xD;Dravid, Vinayak P&#xD;Meade, Thomas J&#xD;R01 EB005866/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB005866-01/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119341-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Chem Mater. 2011 May 24;23(10):2657-2664.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21603070</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3097046</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/cm200509g</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>71</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">71</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schultz, K.

Geminin is widely expressed in the CNS during throughout embryonic development, and Geminin expression is down-regulated when neuronal precursor cells undergo terminal differentiation. Over-expression of Geminin in gastrula-stage Xenopus embryos can expand the size of the neural plate. The role of Geminin in regulating vertebrate neurogenesis in vivo has not been rigorously examined. To address this question, we created a strain of Nestin-Cre/Gmnn(fl/fl) mice in which the Geminin gene was specifically deleted from NSCs. Interestingly, we found no major defects in the development or function of the central nervous system. Neural-specific Gmnn(Delta/Delta) mice are viable and fertile and display no obvious neurological or neuroanatomical abnormalities. They have normal numbers of BrdU(+) NSCs in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, and Gmnn(Delta/Delta) NSCs give rise to normal numbers of mature neurons in pulse-chase experiments. Gmnn(Delta/Delta) neurosphere cells differentiate normally into both neurons and glial cells when grown in growth factor-deficient medium. Both the growth rate and the cell cycle distribution of cultured Gmnn(Delta/Delta) neurosphere cells are indistinguishable from controls. We conclude that Geminin is largely dispensable for most of embryonic and adult mammalian neurogenesis.</abstract><notes>Schultz, Kathryn M; Banisadr, Ghazal; Lastra, Ruben O; McGuire, Tammy; Kessler, John A; Miller, Richard J; McGarry, Thomas J; United States; PloS one; PLoS One. 2011 Mar 9;6(3):e17736.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21408022</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>PMC3052383</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0017736</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1226</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1226</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sanchez-Cortes, J.</author><author>Mrksich, M.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Department of Chemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The University of Chicago, Illinois 60637, United States.</auth-address><titles><title>Using self-assembled monolayers to understand alpha8beta1-mediated cell adhesion to RGD and FEI motifs in nephronectin</title><secondary-title>Acs Chemical Biology</secondary-title><alt-title>ACS chemical biology</alt-title></titles><pages>1078-86</pages><volume>6</volume><number>10</number><edition>2011/07/28</edition><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Motifs</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Integrins/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Oligopeptides/*metabolism</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>Oct 21</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1554-8937 (Electronic)&#xD;1554-8929 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>21790180</accession-num><abstract>Nephronectin is an extracellular matrix protein that interacts with the alpha8beta1 integrin receptor and plays a role in tissue and organ development, though the motifs that mediate adhesion to the receptor remain unclear. This paper describes the use of self-assembled monolayers to study the adhesion of alpha8beta1-presenting cells to the RGD and DLFEIFEIER ligands in nephronectin and found that both ligands can independently mediate cell adhesion through nonoverlapping binding sites on the integrin. Peptide truncation experiments showed FEI to be the minimal binding sequence within the DLFEIFEIER sequence, and adhesion experiments with peptides that include both the RGD and FEI sequences demonstrate that the two peptides bind synergistically to the receptor. Finally, a peptide array was used to establish a strict requirement for the glutamate residue of FEI and tolerance of other aromatic and hydrophobic residues in the first and third positions, respectively. This work provides an enhanced understanding of the binding of nephronectin with alpha8beta1 and identifies a peptide ligand that can be used for targeting the alpha8beta1 integrin.</abstract><notes>Sanchez-Cortes, Juan&#xD;Mrksich, Milan&#xD;U54 CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;ACS Chem Biol. 2011 Oct 21;6(10):1078-86.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying some of the hallmark abnormalities of Chuvash polycythemia, such as hypersensitivity to erythropoietin, are unclear. Here we show that VHL directly binds suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) to form a heterodimeric E3 ligase that targets phosphorylated JAK2 (pJAK2) for ubiquitin-mediated destruction. In contrast, Chuvash polycythemia-associated VHL mutants have altered affinity for SOCS1 and do not engage with and degrade pJAK2. Systemic administration of a highly selective JAK2 inhibitor, TG101209, reversed the disease phenotype in Vhl(R200W/R200W) knock-in mice, an experimental model that recapitulates human Chuvash polycythemia. These results show that VHL is a SOCS1-cooperative negative regulator of JAK2 and provide biochemical and preclinical support for JAK2-targeted therapy in individuals with Chuvash polycythemia.</abstract><notes>Russell, Ryan C; Sufan, Roxana I; Zhou, Bing; Heir, Pardeep; Bunda, Severa; Sybingco, Stephanie S; Greer, Samantha N; Roche, Olga; Heathcote, Samuel A; Chow, Vinca W K; Boba, Lukasz M; Richmond, Terri D; Hickey, Michele M; Barber, Dwayne L; Cheresh, David A; Simon, M Celeste; Irwin, Meredith S; Kim, William Y; Ohh, Michael; R01 CA142794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA142794-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Howard Hughes Medical Institute/; Nat Med. 2011 Jun 19;17(7):845-53. doi: 10.1038/nm.2370.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21685897</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3221316</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nm.2370</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>560</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">560</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rupaimoole, R.</author><author>Han, H.

METHODS: A prospective study of 20 consecutive subjects with biopsy-proven invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tumors 1 cm was conducted. Following excision, incisions were made into the tumor with the two devices. Thermal injury depth, margin distance, tissue type, and histological effect were compared on the same breast tissue cut with each excision instrument. A probability evaluation of close and positive margin cases for the true tumor margins was conducted. RESULTS: Compared to traditional electrosurgery, the low-thermal-injury instrument reduced collagen denaturation depth from 435 to 102 microm (77%), fused tissue depth from 262 to 87 microm (67%), and distortion depth from 1,132 to 774 microm (30%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on analysis of the close subset of the true margins, using the traditional electrosurgical device in place of the low-thermal-injury device would have resulted in 48% of the close margin samples being negatively converted to false-positive, and in 11% converting from close to false-negative. The methodology of this work may be readily applied to larger, more definitive studies.</abstract><notes>Ruidiaz, Manuel E&#xD;Cortes-Mateos, Maria J&#xD;Sandoval, Sergio&#xD;Martin, David T&#xD;Wang-Rodriguez, Jessica&#xD;Hasteh, Farnaz&#xD;Wallace, Anne&#xD;Vose, Joshua G&#xD;Kummel, Andrew C&#xD;Blair, Sarah L&#xD;J Surg Oncol. 2011 Dec;104(7):746-54. doi: 10.1002/jso.22012.

To gain insights on the nature of this unique reaction, we explored this process via the stepwise addition of bidentate phosphino-chalcoether (P, X; X = S or Se) and relevant monodentate phosphine ligands with a Pt(II) metal precursor. The corresponding monoligated complexes were obtained in quantitative yields by reacting 1 equiv of a P, X bidentate ligand with Pt(II) and were fully characterized via single crystal X-ray diffraction studies and heteronuclear ((31)P, (77)Se, and (195)Pt) NMR spectroscopy in solution. These species were further reacted with a second equivalent of either a bidentate ligand or the monodentate ethyl diphenylphosphine ligand, resulting in the clean formation of the heteroligated species or, in the case of the monodentate ligand with an electron-withdrawing bidentate ligand, a mixture of products. On the basis of competitive exchange reactions between these heteroligated, homoligated, and monoligated complexes, we conclude that ligand chelation plays a crucial role in the Pt(II) HILR. The in situ preferable formation of the stable monoligated complex allows for ligand sorting to occur in these systems. In all cases where the heteroligated product results, the driving force to these species is ligand chelation.</abstract><notes>Rosen, Mari S; Spokoyny, Alexander M; Machan, Charles W; Stern, Charlotte; Sarjeant, Amy; Mirkin, Chad A; U54 CA151880-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151880-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151880-02S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151880-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Inorg Chem. 2011 Feb 21;50(4):1411-9.

Strategies for designing enzyme-activated probes based on a variety of molecular scaffolds including small molecules, organic and inorganic nanoparticles, and genetically encoded proteins for commonly used molecular imaging modalities--whole body optical (fluorescence, bioluminescence) imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and radionuclide-based tomographic imaging, are critically evaluated.

Exon 10 of the human tau gene, which codes for a microtubule binding repeat region, is alternatively spliced to form Tau protein isoforms containing either four or three microtubule binding repeats, Tau4R and Tau3R, respectively. The levels of different Tau splicing isoforms are fine-tuned by alternative splicing with the ratio of Tau4R/Tau3R maintained approximately at one in adult neurons. Mutations that disrupt tau exon 10 splicing regulation cause an imbalance of different tau splicing isoforms and have been associated with tauopathy. To search for factors interacting with tau pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) and regulating tau exon 10 alternative splicing, we performed a yeast RNA-protein interaction screen and identified polypyrimidine tract binding protein associated splicing factor (PSF) as a candidate tau exon 10 splicing regulator. UV crosslinking experiments show that PSF binds to the stem-loop structure at the 5&apos; splice site downstream of tau exon 10. This PSF-interacting RNA element is distinct from known PSF binding sites previously identified in other genes. Overexpression of PSF promotes tau exon 10 exclusion, whereas down-regulation of the endogenous PSF facilitates exon 10 inclusion. Immunostaining shows that PSF is expressed in the human brain regions affected by tauopathy. Our data reveal a new player in tau exon 10 alternative splicing regulation and uncover a previously unknown mechanism of PSF in regulating tau pre-mRNA splicing.</abstract><notes>Ray, Payal&#xD;Kar, Amar&#xD;Fushimi, Kazuo&#xD;Havlioglu, Necat&#xD;Chen, Xiaoping&#xD;Wu, Jane Y&#xD;R01 AG033004/AG/NIA NIH HHS/&#xD;R56NS074763/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;J Mol Neurosci. 2011 Nov;45(3):453-66.

Deposited Abeta reacts with activated microglia to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytochemokines, which lead to severe neuroinflammation. Curcumin is a yellow polyphenol compound found in turmeric, a widely used culinary ingredient that possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties and may show efficacy as a potential therapeutic agent in several neuro-inflammatory diseases including AD. However, poor aqueous solubility and sub-optimal systemic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract may represent factors contributing to its failure in clinical trials. To increase curcumin&apos;s bioavailability, a polymeric nanoparticle encapsulated curcumin (NanoCurc) was formulated which is completely water soluble. NanoCurc treatment protects neuronally differentiated human SK-N-SH cells from ROS (H2O2) mediated insults. NanoCurc also rescues differentiated human SK-N-SH cells, which were previously insulted with H2O2. In vivo, intraperitoneal (IP) NanoCurc injection at a dose of 25mg/kg twice daily in athymic mice resulted in significant curcumin levels in the brain (0.32 mug/g). Biochemical study of NanoCurc-treated athymic mice revealed decreased levels of H2O2 as well as caspase 3 and caspase 7 activities in the brain, accompanied by increased glutathione (GSH) concentrations. Increased free to oxidized glutathione (GSH:GSSH) ratio in athymic mice brain versus controls also indicated a favorable redox intracellular environment. Taken together, these results suggest that NanoCurc represents an optimized formulation worthy of assessing the therapeutic value of curcumin in AD.</abstract><notes>Ray, Balmiki; Bisht, Savita; Maitra, Amarnath; Maitra, Anirban; Lahiri, Debomoy K; AG18379/AG/NIA NIH HHS/; AG18884/AG/NIA NIH HHS/; P30CA069773/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 AG018379-10/AG/NIA NIH HHS/; R01 AG018884-10/AG/NIA NIH HHS/; U54 CA151838-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; UL1RR025005/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; Netherlands; J Alzheimers Dis. 2011;23(1):61-77.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20930270</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3303195</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.3233/JAD-2010-101374</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>511</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">511</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rauwerdink, A.

Though an array of techniques can detect binding in vitro, the search for a robust in vivo method continues. The spectral response of magnetic nanoparticles can be influenced by a variety of changes in their physical environment including viscosity and binding. Here, the authors show that nanoparticles in these different environmental states produce spectral responses, which are sufficiently unique to allow for simultaneous quantification of the proportion of nanoparticles within each state. METHODS: The authors measured the response to restricted Brownian motion using an array of magnetic nanoparticle designs. With a chosen optimal particle type, the authors prepared particle samples in three distinct environmental states. Various combinations of particles within these three states were measured concurrently and the authors attempted to solve for the quantity of particles within each physical state. RESULTS: The authors found the spectral response of the nanoparticles to be sufficiently unique to allow for accurate quantification of up to three bound states with errors on the order of 1.5%. Furthermore, the authors discuss numerous paths for translating these measurements to in vivo applications. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple nanoparticle environmental states can be concurrently quantified using the spectral response of the particles. Such an ability, if translated to the in vivo realm, could provide valuable information about the fate of nanoparticles in vivo or improve the efficacy of nanoparticle based treatments.</abstract><notes>Rauwerdink, Adam M; Weaver, John B; CA 151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Med Phys. 2011 Mar;38(3):1136-40.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21520825</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3055696</custom2><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>350</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">350</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raha, S.</author><author>Paunesku, T.</author><author>Woloschak, G.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Department of Radiation Oncology, Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H Lurie Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.</auth-address><titles><title>Peptide-mediated cancer targeting of nanoconjugates</title><secondary-title>Wiley Interdiscip Rev Nanomed Nanobiotechnol</secondary-title><alt-title>Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

Moieties that can be used for such a purpose include small molecules as well as polymers made of different biological and organic materials. Short amino acid polymers, peptides, can often rival target binding avidity of much larger molecules. At the same time, peptides are smaller than most nanoparticles and thus allow for multiple nanoparticle modifications and creation of pluripotent nanoparticles. Most nanoparticles provide multiple binding sites for different cargo and targeting peptides which can be used for the development of novel approaches for cancer targeting, diagnostics, and therapy. In this review, we will focus on peptides which have been used for the preparation of different nanoparticles designed for cancer research.</abstract><notes>Raha, Sumita; Paunesku, Tatjana; Woloschak, Gayle; R01EB002100/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Wiley Interdiscip Rev Nanomed Nanobiotechnol. 2011 May-Jun;3(3):269-81. doi: 10.1002/wnan.121.

We have developed a novel MR imaging probe targeting to HER2, a biomarker for various cancer types and a drug target for anti-cancer therapies. This multimodal HER20targeted MR imaging probe integrates a de novo designed protein contrast agent with a high affinity HER2 affibody and a near IR fluorescent dye. Our probe can differentially monitor tumors with different expression levels of HER2 in both human cell lines and xenograft mice models. In addition to its 100-fold higher dose efficiency compared to clinically approved non-targeting contrast agent DTPA, our developed agent also exhibits advantages in crossing the endothelial boundary, tissue distribution, and tumor tissue retention over reported contrast agents as demonstrated by even distribution of the imaging probe across the entire tumor mass. This contrast agent will provide a powerful tool for quantitative assessment of molecular markers, and improved resolution for diagnosis, prognosis and drug discovery.</abstract><notes>Qiao, Jingjuan; Li, Shunyi; Wei, Lixia; Jiang, Jie; Long, Robert; Mao, Hui; Wei, Ling; Wang, Liya; Yang, Hua; Grossniklaus, Hans E; Liu, Zhi-Ren; Yang, Jenny J; CA118113/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB007268/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; GM62999/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; PLoS One. 2011 Mar 24;6(3):e18103.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21455310</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3063795</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0018103</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>322</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">322</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prigodich, A.

Aberrations of miRNA include overexpression of oncogenic miRs (Onco-miRs) or downregulation of so-called tumor suppressor TSG-miRs. Restitution of TSG-miRs in cancer cells through systemic delivery is a promising avenue for pancreatic cancer therapy. We have synthesized a lipid-based nanoparticle for systemic delivery of miRNA expression vectors to cancer cells (nanovector). The plasmid DNA-complexed nanovector is approximately 100 nm in diameter and shows no apparent histopathologic or biochemical evidence of toxicity upon intravenous injection. Two miRNA candidates known to be downregulated in the majority of pancreatic cancers were selected for nanovector delivery: miR-34a, which is a component of the p53 transcriptional network and regulates cancer stem cell survival, and the miR-143/145 cluster, which together repress the expression of KRAS2 and its downstream effector Ras-responsive element binding protein-1 (RREB1). Systemic intravenous delivery with either miR-34a or miR-143/145 nanovectors inhibited the growth of MiaPaCa-2 subcutaneous xenografts (P &lt; 0.01 for miR-34a; P &lt; 0.05 for miR-143/145); the effects were even more pronounced in the orthotopic (intrapancreatic) setting (P &lt; 0.0005 for either nanovector) when compared with vehicle or mock nanovector delivering an empty plasmid. Tumor growth inhibition was accompanied by increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation. The miRNA restitution was confirmed in treated xenografts by significant upregulation of the corresponding miRNA and significant decreases in specific miRNA targets (SIRT1, CD44 and aldehyde dehydrogenase for miR34a, and KRAS2 and RREB1 for miR-143/145). The nanovector is a platform with potential broad applicability in systemic miRNA delivery to cancer cells.</abstract><notes>Pramanik, Dipankar; Campbell, Nathaniel R; Karikari, Collins; Chivukula, Raghu; Kent, Oliver A; Mendell, Joshua T; Maitra, Anirban; P01CA134292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA113669-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA113669-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA113669-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA113669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151838-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151838-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Howard Hughes Medical Institute/; Mol Cancer Ther. 2011 Aug;10(8):1470-80.

Recent studies suggest that nanoarchitectural changes occur within cells during early carcinogenesis and that such changes precede microscopically evident tissue alterations. It follows that the ability to comprehensively interrogate cell nanoarchitecture (e.g., macromolecular complexes, DNA, RNA, proteins and lipid membranes) could be critical to the diagnosis of early carcinogenesis. We present a study of the nanoscale mass-density fluctuations of biological tissues by quantifying their degree of disorder at the nanoscale. Transmission electron microscopy images of human tissues are used to construct corresponding effective disordered optical lattices. The properties of nanoscale disorder are then studied by statistical analysis of the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the spatially localized eigenfunctions of these optical lattices at the nanoscale. Our results show an increase in the disorder of human colonic epithelial cells in subjects harboring early stages of colon neoplasia. Furthermore, our findings strongly suggest that increased nanoscale disorder correlates with the degree of tumorigenicity. Therefore, the IPR technique provides a practicable tool for the detection of nanoarchitectural alterations in the earliest stages of carcinogenesis. Potential applications of the technique for early cancer screening and detection are also discussed.</abstract><notes>Pradhan, Prabhakar; Damania, Dhwanil; Joshi, Hrushikesh M; Turzhitsky, Vladimir; Subramanian, Hariharan; Roy, Hemant K; Taflove, Allen; Dravid, Vinayak P; Backman, Vadim; DMR-0603184/PHS HHS/; R01 CA128641-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 EB003682-01A2/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01CA128641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01EB003682/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; U54 CA143869-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151880-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA119341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA143869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Phys Biol. 2011 Apr;8(2):026012.

These carriers relied primarily on the size dependence of the enhanced permeability and retention effect to passively target vasculature, resulting in inefficient delivery due to significant variation in endothelial permeability. Enhanced delivery typically requires active targeting via receptor-mediated endocytosis by surface conjugation of targeting ligands. However, vascular carriers (VCs) still face numerous challenges en route to reaching their targets before delivery. The control of carrier shape offers opportunities to overcome in vivo barriers and enhance vascular drug delivery. Geometric features influence the ability of carrier particles to navigate physiological flow patterns, evade biological clearance mechanisms, sustain circulation, adhere to the vascular surface, and finally transport across or internalize into the endothelium. Although previous formulation strategies limited the fabrication of nonspherical carriers, numerous recent advances in both top-down and bottom-up fabrication techniques have enabled shape modulation as a key design element. As part of a series on vascular drug delivery, this review focuses on recent developments in novel vascular platforms with controlled geometry that enhance or modulate delivery functions. Starting with an overview of controlled geometry platforms, we review their shape-dependent functional characteristics for each stage of their vascular journey in vivo. We sequentially explore carrier geometries that evade reticuloendothelial system uptake, display enhanced circulation persistence and margination dynamics in flow, encourage adhesion to the vascular surface or extravasation through endothelium, and impact extravascular transport and cell internalization. The eventual biodistribution of VCs results from the culmination of their successive navigation of all these barriers and is profoundly influenced by their morphology. To enhance delivery efficacy, carrier designs synergistically combining controlled geometry with standard drug delivery strategies such as targeting moieties, surface decorations, and bulk material properties are discussed. Finally, we speculate on possibilities for innovation, harnessing shape as a design parameter for the next generation of vascular drug delivery platforms.</abstract><notes>Pillai, Jonathan D; Dunn, Stuart S; Napier, Mary E; DeSimone, Joseph M; England; IUBMB Life. 2011 Aug;63(8):596-606. doi: 10.1002/iub.497.

Hyperthermia has been shown to work effectively with radiation and chemotherapy cancer treatments. The major obstacle faced by previous hyperthermia techniques has been the inability to deliver heat to the tumor in a precise manner. The ability to deliver cytotoxic hyperthermia to tumors (from within individual cells) via iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (mNP) is a promising new technology that has the ability to greatly improve the therapeutic ratio of hyperthermia as an individual modality and as an adjuvant therapy in combination with other modalities. Although the parameters have yet to be conclusively defined, preliminary data suggests mNP hyperthermia can achieve greater cytotoxicity (in vitro) than conventional water bath hyperthermia methods. At this time, our theory is that intracellular nanoparticle heating is more effective in achieving the combined effect than extracellular heating techniques.1 However, understanding the importance of mNP association and uptake is critical in understanding the potential novelty of the heating modality. Our preliminary data suggests that the mNP heating technique, which did not provide time for particle uptake by the cells, resulted in similar efficacy to microwave hyperthermia. mNP hyperthermia/cisplatinum results have shown a tumor growth delay greater than either modality alone at comparable doses.</abstract><notes>10.1117/12.876535</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.876535</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.876535</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1222</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1222</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Personick, M.

By integrating therapeutic and imaging agents into one nanoparticle, this new treatment strategy has the potential not only to detect and diagnose disease but also to treat and monitor the therapeutic response. This capability could have a profound impact in both the research setting as well as in a clinical setting. In the research setting, such a capability will allow research scientists to rapidly assess the performance of new therapeutics in an effort to iterate their designs for increased therapeutic index and efficacy. In the clinical setting, theranostics offers the ability to determine whether patients enrolling in clinical trials are responding, or are expected to respond, to a given therapy based on the hypothesis associated with the biological mechanisms being tested. If not, patients can be more quickly removed from the clinical trial and shifted to other therapeutic options. To be effective, these theranostic agents must be highly site specific. Optimally, they will carry relevant cargo, demonstrate controlled release of that cargo, and include imaging probes with a high signal-to-noise ratio. There are many biological barriers in the human body that challenge the efficacy of nanoparticle delivery vehicles. These barriers include, but are not limited to, the walls of blood vessels, the physical entrapment of particles in organs, and the removal of particles by phagocytic cells. The rapid clearance of circulating particles during systemic delivery is a major challenge; current research seeks to define key design parameters that govern the performance of nanocarriers, such as size, surface chemistry, elasticity, and shape. The effect of particle size and surface chemistry on in vivo biodistribution of nanocarriers has been extensively studied, and general guidelines have been established. Recently it has been documented that shape and elasticity can have a profound effect on the behavior of delivery vehicles. Thus, having the ability to independently control shape, size, matrix, surface chemistry, and modulus is crucial for designing successful delivery agents. In this Account, we describe the use of particle replication in nonwetting templates (PRINT) to fabricate shape- and size-specific microparticles and nanoparticles. A particular strength of the PRINT method is that it affords precise control over shape, size, surface chemistry, and modulus. We have demonstrated the loading of PRINT particles with chemotherapeutics, magnetic resonance contrast agents, and fluorophores. The surface properties of the PRINT particles can be easily modified with &quot;stealth&quot; poly(ethylene glycol) chains to increase blood circulation time, with targeting moieties for targeted delivery or with radiolabels for nuclear imaging. These particles have tremendous potential for applications in nanomedicine and diagnostics.</abstract><notes>Perry, Jillian L; Herlihy, Kevin P; Napier, Mary E; Desimone, Joseph M; 1R01EB009565/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; 1R21HL092814/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; U54-CA119373/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54-CA151652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Acc Chem Res. 2011 Oct 18;44(10):990-8.

Here, we have developed EGFR-targeted heparin-DDP (EHDDP) nanoparticles for tumor-targeted delivery of DDP. This nanoparticle delivery system possesses the following unique properties: (i) succinic anhydride-modified heparin is biocompatible and biodegradable with no anticoagulant activity; (ii) single-chain variable fragment anti-EGFR antibody (ScFvEGFR) was conjugated to the nanoparticles as an EGFR-targeting ligand. Our results showed that EHDDP nanoparticles can significantly increase the intracellular concentrations of DDP and Pt-DNA adducts in EGFR-expressing non-small cell lung cancer H292 cells via an EGFR-mediated pathway. Compared to the free DDP, significantly prolonged blood circulation time and improved pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of Pt were observed after systemic delivery of the EHDDP nanoparticles. The new EHDDP nanoparticle delivery system significantly enhanced antitumor activity of DDP without weight loss or damage to the kidney and spleen in nude mice bearing H292 cell tumors.</abstract><notes>Peng, Xiang-Hong; Wang, Yiqing; Huang, Donghai; Wang, Yuxiang; Shin, Hyung Juc; Chen, Zhengjia; Spewak, Michael B; Mao, Hui; Wang, Xu; Wang, Ying; Chen, Zhuo Georgia; Nie, Shuming; Shin, Dong M; P50 CA128613-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA128613-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50CA128613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 CA151802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 CA151802-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 CA151802-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119338-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA119338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2011 Dec 27;5(12):9480-93.

Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are believed to have undergone EMT and thus lack or express low levels of epithelial markers commonly used for enrichment and/or detection of such cells. However, most current CTC detection methods target only EpCAM and/or cytokeratin (CK) to enrich epithelial CTCs, resulting in failure to recognize other, perhaps more important, CTC phenotypes that lack expression of these markers. Here, we describe a population of complex aneuploid CTCs that do not express CK or CD45 antigen in patients with breast, ovarian, or colorectal cancer. These cells were not observed in healthy subjects. We show that the primary epithelial tumors were characterized by similar complex aneuploidy, indicating conversion to an EMT phenotype in the captured cells. Collectively, our study provides a new method for highly efficient capture of previously unrecognized populations of CTCs.</abstract><notes>Pecot, Chad V; Bischoff, Farideh Z; Mayer, Julie Ann; Wong, Karina L; Pham, Tam; Bottsford-Miller, Justin; Stone, Rebecca L; Lin, Yvonne G; Jaladurgam, Padmavathi; Roh, Ju Won; Goodman, Blake W; Merritt, William M; Pircher, Tony J; Mikolajczyk, Stephen D; Nick, Alpa M; Celestino, Joseph; Eng, Cathy; Ellis, Lee M; Deavers, Michael T; Sood, Anil K; P50 CA083639-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA098258-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA109298-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA110793-05S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2 GM092599-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; T32 CA009666-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA101642-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Discov. 2011 Dec;1(7):580-6.

Magnetic field heating by the hysteresis loop mechanism at frequencies between about 100 and 300 kHz has proven to be an effective mechanism in magnetic nanoparticles. Experiments at 2.45 GHz show that Fe3O4 magnetite nanoparticle dispersions in the range of 1012 to 1013 NP/mL also heat substantially at this frequency. An FEM numerical model study was undertaken to estimate the order of magnitude of volume power density, Qgen (W m-3) required to achieve significant heating in evenly dispersed and aggregated clusters of nanoparticles. The FEM models were computed using Comsol Multiphysics; consequently the models were confined to continuum formulations and did not include film nano-dimension heat transfer effects at the nanoparticle surface. As an example, the models indicate that for a single 36 nm diameter particle at an equivalent dispersion of 1013 NP/mL located within one control volume (1.0 x 10-19 m3) of a capillary vessel a power density in the neighborhood of 1017 (W m-3) is required to achieve a steady state particle temperature of 52°C - the total power coupled to the particle is 2.44 μW. As a uniformly distributed particle cluster moves farther from the capillary the required power density decreases markedly. Finally, the tendency for particles in vivo to cluster together at separation distances much less than those of the uniform distribution further reduces the required power density.</abstract><notes>10.1117/12.875288</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.875288</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.875288</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1221</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1221</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patel, P.

Dicer and serum nucleases show lower preference for blunt duplexes as opposed to those with 3&apos; overhangs. Importantly, gold nanoparticles functionalized with blunt duplexes with relatively less thermal breathing are up to 15 times more stable against serum degradation without compromising Dicer recognition.

METHODS: Expression of p130cas in ovarian tumors, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, was associated with tumor characteristics and patient survival. The effects of p130cas gene silencing with small interfering RNAs incorporated into neutral nanoliposomes (siRNA-DOPC), alone and in combination with docetaxel, on in vivo tumor growth and on tumor cell proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling) were examined in mice bearing orthotopic taxane-sensitive (HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1) or taxane-resistant (HeyA8-MDR) ovarian tumors (n = 10 per group). To determine the specific mechanisms by which p130cas gene silencing abrogates tumor growth, we measured cell viability (MTT assay), apoptosis (fluorescence-activated cell sorting), autophagy (immunoblotting, fluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy), and cell signaling (immunoblotting) in vitro. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of 91 ovarian cancer specimens, 70 (76%) had high p130cas expression; and 21 (24%) had low p130cas expression. High p130cas expression was associated with advanced tumor stage (P &lt; .001) and higher residual disease (&gt;1 cm) following primary cytoreduction surgery (P = .007) and inversely associated with overall survival and progression-free survival (median overall survival: high p130cas expression vs low expression, 2.14 vs 9.1 years, difference = 6.96 years, 95% confidence interval = 1.69 to 9.48 years, P &lt; .001; median progression-free survival: high p130cas expression vs low expression, 1.04 vs 2.13 years, difference = 1.09 years, 95% confidence interval = 0.47 to 2.60 years, P = .01). In mice bearing orthotopically implanted HeyA8 or SKOV3ip1 ovarian tumors, treatment with p130cas siRNA-DOPC in combination with docetaxel chemotherapy resulted in the greatest reduction in tumor growth compared with control siRNA therapy (92%-95% reduction in tumor growth; P &lt; .001 for all). Compared with control siRNA therapy, p130cas siRNA-DOPC reduced SKOV3ip1 cell proliferation (31% reduction, P &lt; .001) and increased apoptosis (143% increase, P &lt; .001) in vivo. Increased tumor cell apoptosis may have persisted despite pan-caspase inhibition by the induction of autophagy and related signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Increased p130cas expression is associated with poor clinical outcome in human ovarian carcinoma, and p130cas gene silencing decreases tumor growth through stimulation of apoptotic and autophagic cell death.</abstract><notes>Nick, Alpa M; Stone, Rebecca L; Armaiz-Pena, Guillermo; Ozpolat, Bulent; Tekedereli, Ibrahim; Graybill, Whitney S; Landen, Charles N; Villares, Gabriel; Vivas-Mejia, Pablo; Bottsford-Miller, Justin; Kim, Hye Sun; Lee, Ju-Seog; Kim, Soo Mi; Baggerly, Keith A; Ram, Prahlad T; Deavers, Michael T; Coleman, Robert L; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K; CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; T32 CA101642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Natl Cancer Inst. 2011 Nov 2;103(21):1596-612.

Recently, our group reported on a novel gene carrier, the micelle-like nanoparticle (MNP), based on the combination of a covalent conjugate of phospholipid and polyethylenimine (PLPEI) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and lipids. These long-circulating MNPs loaded with plasmid DNA-mediated gene expression in distal tumors after systemic administration in vivo. In the current study, we investigated the potential of MNPs for siRNA delivery. MNPs were prepared by condensing siRNA with PLPEI at a nitrogen/phosphate ratio of 10, where the binding of siRNA is complete. The addition of a PEG/lipid coating to the PLPEI complexes generated particles with sizes of ca. 200 nm and a neutral surface charge compared with positively charged PLPEI polyplexes without the additional coating. MNPs protected the loaded siRNA against enzymatic digestion and enhanced the cellular uptake of the siRNA payload. MNPs carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP)-targeted siRNA effectively downregulated the gene in cells that stably express GFP. Finally, MNPs were non-toxic at a wide range of concentrations and for different cell lines.</abstract><notes>Navarro, Gemma&#xD;Sawant, Rupa R&#xD;Essex, Sean&#xD;Tros de Ilarduya, Conchita&#xD;Torchilin, Vladimir P&#xD;U54 CA151881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Drug Deliv Transl Res. 2011 Feb 1;1(1):25-33.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22916337</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3423223</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s13346-010-0004-0</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1282</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1282</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nathanson, D.</author><author>Mischel, P.

In this issue of the JCI, Staquicini and colleagues apply an in vivo phage-displayed library of random peptides to identify differentially expressed peptides that can be used to transport targeted agents across the intact BBB. The authors uncover a non-canonical, peptide-mediated iron-mimicry mechanism to induce transport of the transferrin/transferrin receptor complex across the BBB. They then demonstrate the ability of phage-targeting approaches to deliver therapeutic cargo and molecular imaging reporters across the BBB in an intracranial glioblastoma mouse model.</abstract><notes>Nathanson, David&#xD;Mischel, Paul S&#xD;CA15189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;T32 CA009056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;J Clin Invest. 2011 Jan;121(1):31-3. doi: 10.1172/JCI45758.

Acquired resistance remains a major obstacle to improving remission rates and achieving prolonged disease-free survival. Consequently, novel approaches to overcome or prevent resistance are of significant clinical importance. There has been considerable interest in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with combinations of EGFR-targeted therapeutics (e.g., erlotinib) and cytotoxic therapeutics (e.g., paclitaxel); however, acquired resistance to erlotinib, driven by a variety of mechanisms, remains an obstacle to treatment success. In about 50% of cases, resistance is due to a T790M point mutation in EGFR, and T790M-containing cells ultimately dominate the tumor composition and lead to tumor regrowth. We employed a combined experimental and mathematical modeling-based approach to identify treatment strategies that impede the outgrowth of primary T790M-mediated resistance in NSCLC populations. Our mathematical model predicts the population dynamics of mixtures of sensitive and resistant cells, thereby describing how the tumor composition, initial fraction of resistant cells, and degree of selective pressure influence the time until progression of disease. Model development relied upon quantitative experimental measurements of cell proliferation and death using a novel microscopy approach. Using this approach, we systematically explored the space of combination treatment strategies and demonstrated that optimally timed sequential strategies yielded large improvements in survival outcome relative to monotherapies at the same concentrations. Our investigations revealed regions of the treatment space in which low-dose sequential combination strategies, after preclinical validation, may lead to a tumor reduction and improved survival outcome for patients with T790M-mediated resistance.</abstract><notes>Journal article; Molecular pharmaceutics; Mol Pharm. 2011 Oct 25.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21995722</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>In Progress</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/mp200270v</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1216</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1216</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Muja, N.</author><author>Cohen, M.

We applied serial, 3D high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to transplanted neural precursor cells (NPCs) labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine, and compared the migration pattern of NPCs in acute inflamed (n = 10) versus chronic demyelinated (n = 9) brains of mice induced with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Serial in vivo and ex-vivo 3D magnetic resonance imaging revealed that NPCs migrated 2.5 +/- 1.3 mm along the corpus callosum in acute EAE. In chronic EAE, cell migration was slightly reduced (2.3 +/- 1.3 mm) and only occurred in the lateral side of transplantation. Surprisingly, in 6/10 acute EAE brains, NPCs were found to migrate in a radial pattern along RECA-1(+) cortical blood vessels, in a pattern hitherto only reported for migrating glioblastoma cells. This striking radial biodistribution pattern was not detected in either chronic EAE or disease-free control brains. In both acute and chronic EAE brain, Iba1(+) microglia/macrophage number was significantly higher in central nervous system regions containing migrating NPCs. The existence of differential NPC migration patterns is an important consideration for implementing future translational studies in multiple sclerosis patients with variable disease.</abstract><notes>Muja, Naser&#xD;Cohen, Mikhal E&#xD;Zhang, Jiangyang&#xD;Kim, Heechul&#xD;Gilad, Assaf A&#xD;Walczak, Piotr&#xD;Ben-Hur, Tamir&#xD;Bulte, Jeff W M&#xD;R01 NS045062-07/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 NS045062-08/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;Magn Reson Med. 2011 Jun;65(6):1738-49. doi: 10.1002/mrm.22757.

Accessible, reliable, and informative cancer biomarkers can be medically valuable and can provide some relevant insights into cancer biology. Recent studies have suggested improvements in detecting malignancies by the use of specific extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) in plasma. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an incurable hematologic disorder, sensitive, early, and noninvasive diagnosis and better disease classification would be very useful for more effective therapies. We show here that circulating miRNAs can be sensitive biomarkers for CLL, because certain extracellular miRNAs are present in CLL patient plasma at levels significantly different from healthy controls and from patients affected by other hematologic malignancies. The levels of several of these circulating miRNAs also displayed significant differences between zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70)(+) and ZAP-70(-) CLL. We also determined that the level of circulating miR-20a correlates reliably with diagnosis-to-treatment time. Network analysis of our data, suggests a regulatory network associated with BCL2 and ZAP-70 expression in CLL. This hypothesis suggests the possibility of using the levels of specific miRNAs in plasma to detect CLL and to determine the ZAP-70 status.</abstract><notes>Moussay, Etienne&#xD;Wang, Kai&#xD;Cho, Ji-Hoon&#xD;van Moer, Kris&#xD;Pierson, Sandrine&#xD;Paggetti, Jerome&#xD;Nazarov, Petr V&#xD;Palissot, Valerie&#xD;Hood, Leroy E&#xD;Berchem, Guy&#xD;Galas, David J&#xD;GM076547/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Apr 19;108(16):6573-8.

The focus of the current study was to determine whether dopamine, an inhibitory catecholamine, could block the effects of chronic stress on tumor growth. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of dopamine receptors (DR1-DR5) was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and by Western blotting. In vitro effects of dopamine on cell viability, apoptosis, and migration were examined. For in vivo therapy, murine and human DR2-siRNAs were incorporated into chitosan nanoparticles (CH-NP). RESULTS: In this model of chronic stress, tumoral norepinephrine levels remained elevated whereas dopamine levels were significantly decreased compared with nonstressed animals. Daily restraint stress resulted in significantly increased tumor growth in both immunodeficient (SKOV3ip1 and HeyA8) and immunocompetent (ID8) ovarian cancer models. This increase was completely blocked with daily dopamine treatment. Dopamine treatment also blocked the stress-induced increase in angiogenesis. Endothelial and ovarian cancer cells expressed all dopamine receptors except for the lack of DR3 expression in ovarian cancer cells. DR2 was responsible for the inhibitory effects of dopamine on tumor growth and microvessel density as well as the stimulatory effect on apoptosis, as the DR2 antagonist eticlopride reversed these effects. Dopamine significantly inhibited cell viability and stimulated apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, dopamine reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibited norepinephrine and vascular permeability factor/VEGF-induced Src kinase activation.

Each peptide module in the branched structure makes unique contributions to affinity and/or specificity resulting in a 200 nM affinity ligand that efficiently immunoprecipitates Akt from cancer cell lysates and labels Akt in fixed cells. Our use of a small molecule to preinhibit Akt prior to screening resulted in low micromolar inhibitory potency and an allosteric mode of inhibition, which is evidenced through a series of competitive enzyme kinetic assays. To demonstrate the efficiency and selectivity of the protein-templated in situ click reaction, we developed a novel QPCR-based methodology that enabled a quantitative assessment of its yield.

Characteristics of MDR include abnormal vasculature, regions of hypoxia, up-regulation of ABC-transporters, aerobic glycolysis, and an elevated apoptotic threshold. Nano-sized delivery vehicles are ideal for treating MDR cancer as they can improve the therapeutic index of drugs and they can be engineered to achieve multifunctional parameters. The multifunctional ability of nanocarriers makes them more adept at treating heterogeneous tumor mass than traditional chemotherapy. Nanocarriers also have preferential tumor accumulation via the EPR effect; this accumulation can be further enhanced by actively targeting the biological profile of MDR cells. Perhaps the most significant benefit of using nanocarrier drug delivery to treat MDR cancer is that nanocarrier delivery diverts the effects of ABC-transporter mediated drug efflux; which is the primary mechanism of MDR. This review discusses the capabilities, applications, and examples of multifunctional nanocarriers for the treatment of MDR. This review emphasizes multifunctional nanocarriers that enhance drug delivery efficiency, the application of RNAi, modulation of the tumor apoptotic threshold, and physical approaches to overcome MDR.</abstract><notes>Milane, Lara; Ganesh, Shanthi; Shah, Shruti; Duan, Zhen-Feng; Amiji, Mansoor; R01 CA119617-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA119617-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA119617-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA119617-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA119617-04S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01-CA119617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01-CA119617S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21 CA135594-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21 CA135594-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01-CA151452/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Netherlands; J Control Release. 2011 Oct 30;155(2):237-47.

Plasma, tumor, and tissue distribution profiles were quantified in an orthotopic animal model of multidrug-resistant breast cancer and were compared to treatment with nontargeted nanoparticles and to treatment with drug solution. A poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)-poly(ethylene glycol)-EGFR targeting peptide (PLGA-PEG-EFGR peptide) construct was synthesized for incorporation in poly(varepsilon-caprolactone) particles to achieve active EGFR targeting. An isocratic high-pressure liquid chromatography method was developed to quantify lonidamine and paclitaxel in mice plasma, tumors, and vital organs. The targeted nanoparticles demonstrated a superior pharmacokinetic profile relative to drug solution and nontargeted nanoparticles, particularly for lonidamine delivery. The first target site of accumulation was the liver, followed by the kidneys, and then the tumor mass; maximal tumor accumulation occured at 3 hours after administration. Lonidamine-paclitaxel combination therapy administered via EGFR-targeted polymer-blend nanocarriers may become a viable platform for the future treatment of multidrug-resistant cancer. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: In this study the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted polymer-blend nanoparticles loaded with lonidamine and paclitaxel were assessed. The targeted nanoparticles demonstrated a superior pharmacokinetic profile relative to drug solution and nontargeted nanoparticles, paving the way to new therapeutic approaches for multidrug-resistant malignancies.</abstract><notes>Milane, Lara; Duan, Zhen-feng; Amiji, Mansoor; R01 CA-119617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA-119617S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA119617-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA119617-04S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21 CA-135594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21 CA135594-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Nanomedicine. 2011 Aug;7(4):435-44.

Hypoxia is an environmental selection pressure that contributes to the development of MDR. Many cancer cells, including MDR cells, resort to glycolysis for energy acquisition. This study aimed to explore the relationship between hypoxia, glycolysis, and MDR in a panel of human breast and ovarian cancer cells. A second aim of this study was to develop an orthotopic animal model of MDR breast cancer. METHODS: Nucleic and basal protein was extracted from a panel of human breast and ovarian cancer cells; MDR cells and cells pre-exposed to either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Western blotting was used to assess the expression of MDR markers, hypoxia inducible factors, and glycolytic proteins. Tumor xenografts were established in the mammary fat pad of nu/nu mice using human breast cancer cells that were pre-exposed to either hypoxic or normoxic conditions. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the MDR character of excised tumors. RESULTS: Hypoxia induces MDR and glycolysis in vitro, but the cellular response is cell-line specific and duration dependent. Using hypoxic, triple-negative breast cancer cells to establish 100 mm3 tumor xenografts in nude mice is a relevant model for MDR breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Hypoxic pre-conditiong and xenografting may be used to develop a multitude of orthotopic models for MDR cancer aiding in the study and treatment of the disease.</abstract><notes>Milane, Lara; Duan, Zhenfeng; Amiji, Mansoor; England; Cancer Cell Int. 2011 Feb 14;11:3.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21320311</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3045873</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1475-2867-11-3</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>905</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">905</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Milane, L.</author><author>Duan, Z.</author><author>Amiji, M.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.</auth-address><titles><title>Therapeutic efficacy and safety of paclitaxel/lonidamine loaded EGFR-targeted nanoparticles for the treatment of multi-drug resistant cancer</title><secondary-title>PLoS One</secondary-title><alt-title>PloS one</alt-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS One</full-title><abbr-1>PloS one</abbr-1></periodical><alt-periodical><full-title>PLoS One</full-title><abbr-1>PloS one</abbr-1></alt-periodical><pages>e24075</pages><volume>6</volume><number>9</number><edition>2011/09/21</edition><keywords><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Cell Line, Tumor</keyword><keyword>Drug Delivery Systems</keyword><keyword>Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Immunohistochemistry</keyword><keyword>Indazoles/administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mice, Nude</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Electron, Scanning</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles/*administration &amp; dosage/ultrastructure</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology</keyword><keyword>P-Glycoproteins/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Paclitaxel/administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor/*antagonists &amp; inhibitors/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Tumor Burden/drug effects</keyword><keyword>Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>1932-6203 (Electronic); 1932-6203 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>21931642</accession-num><abstract>The treatment of multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancer is a clinical challenge. Many MDR cells over-express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We exploit this expression through the development of EGFR-targeted, polymer blend nanocarriers for the treatment of MDR cancer using paclitaxel (a common chemotherapeutic agent) and lonidamine (an experimental drug; mitochondrial hexokinase 2 inhibitor). An orthotopic model of MDR human breast cancer was developed in nude mice and used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nanoparticle treatment. The efficacy parameters included tumor volume measurements from day 0 through 28 days post-treatment, terminal tumor weight measurements, tumor density and morphology assessment through hematoxylin and eosin staining of excised tumors, and immunohistochemistry of tumor sections for MDR protein markers (P-glycoprotein, Hypoxia Inducible Factor, EGFR, Hexokinase 2, and Stem Cell Factor). Toxicity was assessed by tracking changes in animal body weight from day 0 through 28 days post-treatment, by measuring plasma levels of the liver enzymes ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), and by white blood cell and platelet counts. In these studies, this nanocarrier system demonstrated superior efficacy relative to combination (paclitaxel/lonidamine) drug solution and single agent treatments in nanoparticle and solution form. The combination nanoparticles were the only treatment group that decreased tumor volume, sustaining this decrease until the 28 day time point. In addition, treatment with the EGFR-targeted lonidamine/paclitaxel nanoparticles decreased tumor density and altered the MDR phenotype of the tumor xenografts. These EGFR-targeted combination nanoparticles were considerably less toxic than solution treatments. Due to the flexible design and simple conjugation chemistry, this nanocarrier system could be used as a platform for the development of other MDR cancer therapies; the use of this system for EGFR-targeted, combination paclitaxel/lonidamine therapy is an advance in personalized medicine.</abstract><notes>Milane, Lara; Duan, Zhenfeng; Amiji, Mansoor; R01 CA-119617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA-119617S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21 CA-135594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24075.

Targeted nanoparticles were made by synthesizing a poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)/poly(ethylene glycol)/epidermal growth factor receptor targeting peptide (PLGA/PEG/EGFR-peptide) construct for incorporation in poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanoparticles. MDR was induced in a panel of nine human breast and ovarian cancer cell lines using hypoxia. EGFR-targeted polymer blend nanoparticles were shown to actively target EGFR overexpressing cell lines, especially upon induction of hypoxia. The nanoparticles were capable of sustained drug release. Combination therapy with lonidamine and paclitaxel significantly improved the therapeutic index of both drugs. Treatment with a nanoparticle dose of 1 muM paclitaxel/10 muM lonidamine resulted in less than 10% cell viability for all hypoxic/MDR cell lines and less than 5% cell viability for all normoxic cell lines. Comparatively, treatment with 1 muM paclitaxel alone was the approximate IC(5)(0) value of the MDR cells while treatment with lonidamine alone had very little effect. The PLGA/PEG/EGFR-peptide delivery system actively targets a MDR cell by exploiting the expression of EGFR. This system treats MDR by inhibiting the Warburg effect and promoting mitochondrial binding of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (lonidamine), while hyperstabilizing microtubules (paclitaxel). This nanocarrier system actively targets a MDR associated phenotype (EGFR receptor overexpression), further enhancing the therapeutic index of both drugs and potentiating the use of lonidamine/paclitaxel combination therapy in the treatment of MDR cancer.</abstract><notes>Milane, Lara; Duan, Zhenfeng; Amiji, Mansoor; R01 CA-119617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA-119617S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21 CA-135594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Mol Pharm. 2011 Feb 7;8(1):185-203.

To explore mechanisms for this association and assess its potential as therapeutic target, the relationship of EphA2 expression to markers of angiogenesis was examined using patient samples and an orthotopic mouse model of uterine cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of EphA2, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Ki-67, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density (MVD) was evaluated using immunohistochemistry in 85 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinomas (EEC) by two independent investigators. Results were correlated with clinicopathological characteristics. The effect of EphA2- agonist monoclonal antibody EA5, alone or in combination with docetaxel was studied in vitro and in vivo. Samples were analyzed for markers of angiogenesis, proliferation and apoptosis. RESULTS: Of 85 EEC samples, EphA2 was overexpressed in 47% of tumors and was significantly associated with high VEGF expression (p=0.001) and high MVD counts (p=0.02). High EphA2 expression, high VEGF expression and high MVD counts were significantly associated with shorter disease-specific survival. EA5 led to decrease in EphA2 expression and phosphorylation in vitro. In the murine model, while EA5 (33-88%) and docetaxel (23-55%) individually led to tumor inhibition over controls, combination therapy had the greatest efficacy (78-92%, p.</abstract><notes>Merritt, William M; Kamat, Aparna A; Hwang, Jee-Young; Bottsford-Miller, Justin; Lu, Chunhua; Lin, Yvonne G; Coffey, Donna; Spannuth, Whitney A; Nugent, Elizabeth; Han, Liz Y; Landen, Charles N; Nick, Alpa M; Stone, Rebecca L; Coffman, Karen; Bruckheimer, Elizabeth; Broaddus, Russell R; Gershenson, David M; Coleman, Robert L; Sood, Anil K; CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; T32 CA101642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Biol Ther. 2011 Jan 12;10(12):1306-14.

We synthesized hydrogel microparticles with tunable elasticity in the physiological range, which resemble red blood cells in size and shape, and tested their behavior in vivo. Decreasing the modulus of these particles altered their biodistribution properties, allowing them to bypass several organs, such as the lung, that entrapped their more rigid counterparts, resulting in increasingly longer circulation times well past those of conventional microparticles. An 8-fold decrease in hydrogel modulus correlated to a greater than 30-fold increase in the elimination phase half-life for these particles.

Image-guided therapies could be designed based on multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs). Such NPs have a strong and tunable surface plasmon resonance absorption in the near-infrared region and can be detected using multiple imaging modalities (magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear imaging, and photoacoustic imaging). These novel nanostructures, once introduced, are expected to home in on solid tumors either via a passive targeting mechanism (i.e., the enhanced permeability and retention effect) or via an active targeting mechanism facilitated by ligands bound to their surfaces. Once the NPs reach their target tissue, their activity can then be turned on using an external stimulus. For example, photothermal conducting NPs primarily act by converting light energy into heat. As a result, the temperature in the treatment volume is elevated above the thermal damage threshold, which kills the cells. This process, termed photothermal ablation therapy (PTA), is effective, but it is also unlikely to kill all tumor cells when used alone. In addition to PTA, photothermal conducting NPs can also efficiently trigger the release of drugs and activate RNA interference. A multimodal approach, which permits simultaneous PTA therapy, chemotherapy, and therapeutic RNA interference, has the potential to completely eradicate residual diseased cells. In this Account, we provide an up-to-date review of the synthesis and characterization, functionalization, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of NIR lightactivatable multifunctional nanostructures used for imaging and therapy. We emphasize research on hollow gold nanospheres, magnetic core-shell gold nanoshells, and semiconductor copper monosulfide NPs. We discuss three types of novel drug delivery systems in which hollow gold nanospheres are used to mediate controlled drug release.</abstract><notes>Melancon, Marites P; Zhou, Min; Li, Chun; CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA119387-05S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50CA097007/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA119387/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U24 CA126577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Acc Chem Res. 2011 Oct 18;44(10):947-56.

PROCEDURES: A human anti-ALCAM single chain variable fragment was reformatted to produce a covalent dimer, termed a cys-diabody (CysDb). Purified CysDb was characterized by gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography, and immunoreactivity was assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Targeting and imaging of ALCAM-positive tumors using (64)Cu-DOTA-CysDb were evaluated in mice bearing human pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenografts (HPAF-II or BxPC-3). RESULTS: CysDb binds specifically to ALCAM-positive cells in vitro with an apparent affinity in the range of 1-3 nM. MicroPET images at 4 h showed specific targeting of positive tumors in vivo, a finding confirmed by biodistribution analysis, with positive/negative tumor ratios of 1.9 +/- 0.6 and 2.4 +/- 0.6, and positive tumor/blood ratios of 2.5 +/- 0.9 and 2.9 +/- 0.6 (HPAF-II and BxPC-3, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Successful imaging with (64)Cu-DOTA-CysDb in animal models suggests further investigation of ALCAM as an imaging biomarker is warranted.</abstract><notes>Journal article; Molecular imaging and biology : MIB : the official publication of the Academy of Molecular Imaging; Mol Imaging Biol. 2011 Jun 1.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21630083</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>In Progress</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11307-011-0500-8</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>868</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">868</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazar, A.

Although uPAR may be expressed transiently in many tissues during development and wound healing, its constitutive expression appears to be associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer. uPAR expression has been demonstrated in most solid tumors and several hematologic malignancies including multiple myeloma and acute leukemias.Unlike many tumor antigens, uPAR is present not only in tumor cells but also in a number of tumor-associated cells including angiogenic endothelial cells and macrophages. The expression of uPAR has been shown to be fairly high in tumor compared to normal, quiescent tissues, which has led to uPAR being proposed as a therapeutic target, as well as a targeting agent, for the treatment of cancer. The majority of therapeutic approaches that have been investigated to date have focused on inhibiting the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)-uPAR interaction but these have not led to the development of a viable uPAR targeted clinical candidate. Genetic knockdown approaches e.g. siRNA, shRNA focused on decreasing uPAR expression have demonstrated robust antitumor activity in pre-clinical studies but have been hampered by the obstacles of stability and drug delivery that have limited the field of RNA nucleic acid based therapeutics. More recently, novel approaches that target interactions of uPAR that are downstream of uPA binding e.g. with integrins or that exploit observations describing the biology of uPAR such as mediating uPA internalization and signaling have generated novel uPAR targeted candidates that are now advancing towards clinic evaluation. This review will discuss some of the pitfalls that have delayed progress on uPAR-targeted interventions and will summarize recent progress in the development of uPAR-targeted therapeutics.</abstract><notes>Mazar, Andrew P; Ahn, Richard W; O&apos;Halloran, Thomas V; U01 CA151461-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01CA151461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Netherlands; Curr Pharm Des. 2011;17(19):1970-8.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21711234</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3188847</custom2><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>65</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">65</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Matson, J.

The inherent biocompatibility and cell signaling capabilities of peptides, in combination with control of secondary structure, has led to the development of a broad range of functional materials with potential for many novel therapies. More recently, membranes formed through complexation of peptide nanostructures with natural biopolymers have led to the development of hierarchically-structured constructs with potentially far-reaching applications in biology and medicine. In this review, we highlight recent advances in peptide-based gels and membranes, including work from our group and others. Specifically, we discuss the application of peptide-based materials in the regeneration of bone and enamel, cartilage, and the central nervous system, as well as the transplantation of islets, wound-healing, cardiovascular therapies, and treatment of erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy.</abstract><notes>R01 DE015920-06/NIDCR NIH HHS/; R01 EB003806-06A2/NIBIB NIH HHS/; U54 CA151880-01/NCI NIH HHS/; Curr Opin Solid State Mater Sci. 2011 Dec;15(6):225-235.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22125413</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>PMC3224089</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cossms.2011.08.001</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>125</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">125</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mastarone, D.

Our system incorporates azide bearing Gd(III) chelates and a trialkyne scaffold with a functional group for subsequent modification. In optimizing the relaxivity of this new complex, we undertook a study of the linker length between a chelate and the scaffold to determine its effect on relaxivity. The results show a strong dependence on flexibility between the individual chelates and the scaffold with decreasing linker length leading to significant increases in relaxivity. Nuclear magnetic resonance dispersion (NMRD) spectra were obtained to confirm a 10-fold increase in the rotational correlation time from 0.049 to 0.60 ns at 310 K. We have additionally obtained a crystal structure demonstrating that modification with an azide does not impact the coordination of the lanthanide. The resulting multinuclear center has a 500% increase in per Gd (or ionic) relaxivity at 1.41 T versus small molecule contrast agents and a 170% increase in relaxivity at 9.4 T.</abstract><notes>Mastarone, Daniel J; Harrison, Victoria S R; Eckermann, Amanda L; Parigi, Giacomo; Luchinat, Claudio; Meade, Thomas J; R01 EB005866-05A1/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States; United States; Journal of the American Chemical Society; J Am Chem Soc. 2011 Apr 13;133(14):5329-37.

Despite the promise, site specific delivery carriers have not been translated into clinical reality. In this study, we have developed long circulating liposomes with the outer surface decorated with thioated oligonucleotide aptamer (thioaptamer) against E-selectin (ESTA) and evaluated the targeting efficacy and PK parameters. In vitro targeting studies using Human Umbilical Cord Vein Endothelial Cell (HUVEC) demonstrated efficient and rapid uptake of the ESTA conjugated liposomes (ESTA-lip). In vivo, the intravenous administration of ESTA-lip resulted in their accumulation at the tumor vasculature of breast tumor xenografts without shortening the circulation half-life. The study presented here represents an exemplary use of thioaptamer and liposome and opens the door to testing various combinations of thioaptamer and nanocarriers that can be constructed to target multiple cancer types and tumor components for delivery of both therapeutics and imaging agent.</abstract><notes>Mann, Aman P; Bhavane, Rohan C; Somasunderam, Anoma; Liz Montalvo-Ortiz, Brenda; Ghaghada, Ketan B; Volk, David; Nieves-Alicea, Rene; Suh, K Stephen; Ferrari, Mauro; Annapragada, Ananth; Gorenstein, David G; Tanaka, Takemi; AI 27744/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/; GM 084552/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; N01-HV-28184/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/; U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Oncotarget. 2011 Apr;2(4):298-304.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21666286</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3248173</custom2><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1214</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1214</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Malin, D.</author><author>Chen, F.</author><author>Schiller, C.</author><author>Koblinski, J.</author><author>Cryns, V.

Endogenous TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) functions as a metastasis suppressor by activating proapoptotic TRAIL receptors (TRAIL-R1/DR4 and/or TRAIL-R2/DR5) in transformed cells, making it an attractive pathway for antimetastatic therapies. However, it is unclear whether TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 is a better therapeutic target in metastatic breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Several metastatic, triple (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2)-negative cancer cell lines were treated with human agonistic monoclonal antibodies targeting TRAIL-R1 (mapatumumab) or TRAIL-R2 (lexatumumab). The effects on cell viability, apoptosis, and caspase-8 activation were determined. An orthotopic model of triple-negative breast cancer in which fluorescently labeled breast cancer cells metastasize from the mammary gland to lymph nodes and lung was utilized to evaluate the effects of mapatumumab, lexatumumab, or doxorubicin on primary and metastatic tumor burden in vivo. RESULTS: Lexatumumab was more effective than mapatumumab in activating caspase-8, inducing apoptosis and inhibiting long-term survival of metastatic cancer cells, which expressed both TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2. Human mammary epithelial cells transformed by oncogenic Ras were more sensitive to lexatumumab than nontransformed cells. Lexatumumab inhibited lymph node and lung metastases more robustly than mapatumumab in an orthotopic model of triple-negative breast cancer; both agents inhibited mammary tumor growth. In addition, lexatumumab was more effective than doxorubicin at suppressing metastases at doses of doxorubicin that were associated with toxicity, even though doxorubicin reduced primary tumor burden more robustly than lexatumumab. CONCLUSION: Targeting TRAIL-R2 receptor may be an effective therapeutic strategy for metastatic breast cancer.</abstract><notes>Malin, Dmitry&#xD;Chen, Feng&#xD;Schiller, Carol&#xD;Koblinski, Jennifer&#xD;Cryns, Vincent L&#xD;Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Aug 1;17(15):5005-15.

Capturing the full spectrum of these functions requires analysis of large numbers of effector molecules from single cells. We report a microfluidic platform designed for highly multiplexed (more than ten proteins), reliable, sample-efficient ( approximately 1 x 10(4) cells) and quantitative measurements of secreted proteins from single cells. We validated the platform by assessment of multiple inflammatory cytokines from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human macrophages and comparison to standard immunotechnologies. We applied the platform toward the ex vivo quantification of T cell polyfunctional diversity via the simultaneous measurement of a dozen effector molecules secreted from tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that were actively responding to tumor and compared against a cohort of healthy donor controls. We observed profound, yet focused, functional heterogeneity in active tumor antigen-specific CTLs, with the major functional phenotypes quantitatively identified. The platform represents a new and informative tool for immune monitoring and clinical assessment.</abstract><notes>Ma, Chao; Fan, Rong; Ahmad, Habib; Shi, Qihui; Comin-Anduix, Begonya; Chodon, Thinle; Koya, Richard C; Liu, Chao-Chao; Kwong, Gabriel A; Radu, Caius G; Ribas, Antoni; Heath, James R; 1 K99 CA136759-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; 5U54CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; AI-28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/; CA-16042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Nat Med. 2011 Jun;17(6):738-43.

We tested the relative cytotoxicity of POx and were able to confirm that these polymers are typically not cytotoxic even at high concentrations. Furthermore, we report structure-uptake relationships of a series of amphiphilic POx block copolymers that have different architectures, molar mass and chain termini. The rate of endocytosis can be fine-tuned over a broad range by changing the polymer structure. The cellular uptake increases with the hydrophobic character of the polymers and is observed even at nanomolar concentrations. Considering the structural versatility of this class of polymers, the relative ease of preparation and their stability underlines the potential of POx as a promising platform candidate for the preparation of next-generation polymer therapeutics.</abstract><notes>Luxenhofer, Robert; Sahay, Gaurav; Schulz, Anita; Alakhova, Daria; Bronich, Tatiana K; Jordan, Rainer; Kabanov, Alexander V; 1P20 RR021937/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; 2R01 CA89225/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P20 RR021937-01A2/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; R01 CA089225-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 CA151806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 CA151806-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Netherlands; J Control Release. 2011 Jul 15;153(1):73-82.

Because ovarian cancer symptoms are subtle and nonspecific, the diagnosis is often delayed until the disease is well advanced. Overall 5-year survival is a rather dismal 50% but can be improved to greater than 90% if the disease is confined to the ovary at the time of diagnosis (generally in fewer than 25% of patients). Effective screening tools are currently not available. Owing to the rather low incidence of the disease in the general population, potential screening tests must provide very high specificity to avoid unnecessary interventions in false-positive cases. This article reviews currently available serum biomarkers and imaging tests for the early detection of ovarian cancer and provides an outlook on the potential improvements in these noninvasive diagnostic tools that may lead to successful implementation in a screening program.

LSPRs, however, are not limited to nanostructures of metals and can also be achieved in semiconductor nanocrystals with appreciable free carrier concentrations. Here, we describe well-defined LSPRs arising from p-type carriers in vacancy-doped semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Achievement of LSPRs by free carrier doping of a semiconductor nanocrystal would allow active on-chip control of LSPR responses. Plasmonic sensing and manipulation of solid-state processes in single nanocrystals constitutes another interesting possibility. We also demonstrate that doped semiconductor QDs allow realization of LSPRs and quantum-confined excitons within the same nanostructure, opening up the possibility of strong coupling of photonic and electronic modes, with implications for light harvesting, nonlinear optics, and quantum information processing.</abstract><notes>Luther, Joseph M; Jain, Prashant K; Ewers, Trevor; Alivisatos, A Paul; England; Nature materials; Nat Mater. 2011 May;10(5):361-6.

Using standard soft lithography and stereo lithography techniques, we fabricated thin zein films with microfluidic chambers and channels. These were bonded to both a glass slide and another zein film. The zein film with microfluidic features bonds irreversibly with other surfaces by vapor-deposition of ethanol to create an adhesive layer resulting in very little or no trapped air and small shape distortion. Zein-zein and zein-glass microfluidic devices demonstrated sufficient strength to facilitate fluid flow in a complex microfluidic design that showed no leakage under high hydraulic pressure. Zein-glass microfluidic devices with serpentine mixing design showed successful fluid manipulation as a concentration gradient of Rhodamine B solution was generated. The ease of fabrication and bonding and the flexibility and moldability of zein offer attractive possibilities for microfluidic device design and manufacturing. These devices can include several unit operations with mixing being one of the most commonly used. The zein-based microfluidic devices, made entirely from a biopolymer from agricultural origin, offer alternative environmentally friendly material choices that are less dependent on limited petroleum based polymer resources.</abstract><notes>Luecha, Jarupat&#xD;Hsiao, Austin&#xD;Brodsky, Serena&#xD;Liu, Gang Logan&#xD;Kokini, Jozef L&#xD;England&#xD;Lab Chip. 2011 Oct 21;11(20):3419-25.

To examine this, we used two-color quantum-dot tracking for visualization of the homodimerization of human erbB1 and quantification of the dimer off-rate (k(off)) on living cells. Kinetic parameters were extracted using a three-state hidden Markov model to identify transition rates between free, co-confined and dimerized states. We report that dimers composed of two ligand-bound receptors are long-lived and their k(off) is independent of kinase activity. By comparison, unliganded dimers have a more than four times faster k(off). Transient co-confinement of receptors promotes repeated encounters and enhances dimer formation. Mobility decreases more than six times when ligand-bound receptors dimerize. Blockade of erbB1 kinase activity or disruption of actin networks results in faster diffusion of receptor dimers. These results implicate both signal propagation and the cortical cytoskeleton in reduced mobility of signaling-competent erbB1 dimers.</abstract><notes>Low-Nam, Shalini T; Lidke, Keith A; Cutler, Patrick J; Roovers, Rob C; van Bergen en Henegouwen, Paul M P; Wilson, Bridget S; Lidke, Diane S; P50 GM085273-01A1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; P50GM0852673/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 CA119232-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA119232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21 RR024438-01A1/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; R21RR024438/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2011 Oct 23;18(11):1244-9. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.2135.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22020299</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3210321</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nsmb.2135</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1212</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1212</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, K.

This technique enables single-molecule analysis of size separated DNA with 100% mass detection efficiency, high sizing resolution and wide dynamic range, surpassing the performance of single molecule capillary electrophoresis. Furthermore, SML-FSHS required only a bare fused silica microcapillary and simple pressure control rather than complex high voltage power supplies, sieving matrices, and wall coatings. The wide dynamic range and high sizing resolution of SML-FSHS was demonstrated by separating both large DNA (23 vs 27 kbp) and small DNA (100 vs 200 bp) under identical conditions. Separations were successfully performed with near zero sample consumption using as little as 5 pL of sample and 240 yoctomoles ( approximately 150 molecules) of DNA. Quantitative accuracy was predominantly limited by molecular shot noise. Furthermore, the ability of this method to analyze of single molecule nanosensors was investigated. SML-FSHS was used to examine the thermodynamic equilibrium between stochastically open molecular beacon and target-bound molecular beacon in the detection of E. coli 16s rRNA targets.</abstract><notes>Liu, Kelvin J&#xD;Rane, Tushar D&#xD;Zhang, Yi&#xD;Wang, Tza-Huei&#xD;P50 CA058184-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50-CA058184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 CA120742-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R21-CA120742/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151838-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54-CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;J Am Chem Soc. 2011 May 11;133(18):6898-901.

A pioneering concept proposed by Ned Seeman 30 years ago has led to an explosion of knowledge in DNA nanotechnology. RNA can be manipulated with simplicity characteristic of DNA, while possessing noncanonical base-pairing, versatile function, and catalytic activity similar to proteins. However, standing in awe of the sensitivity of RNA to RNase degradation has made many scientists flinch away from RNA nanotechnology. Here we report the construction of stable RNA nanoparticles resistant to RNase digestion. The 2&apos;-F (2&apos;-fluoro) RNA retained its property for correct folding in dimer formation, appropriate structure in procapsid binding, and biological activity in gearing the phi29 nanomotor to package viral DNA and producing infectious viral particles.

Despite the promises, effective transport of siRNA with minimal side effects remains a challenge. In this study, a nonviral nanoparticle gene carrier is developed and its efficiency for siRNA delivery and transfection is validated at both in vitro and in vivo levels. Such a nanocarrier, abbreviated as Alkyl-PEI2k-IO, was constructed with a core of iron oxide nanoparticles (IOs) and a shell of alkylated polyethyleneimine of 2000 Da [corrected] molecualr weight (Alkyl-PEI2k). It is found to be able to bind with siRNA, resulting in well-dispersed nanoparticles with a controlled clustering structure and narrow size distribution. Electrophoresis studies show that the Alkyl-PEI2k-IOs could retard siRNA completely at N:P ratios (i.e., PEI nitrogen to nucleic acid phosphate) above 10, protect siRNA from enzymatic degradation in serum, and release complexed siRNA efficiently in the presence of polyanionic heparin. The knockdown efficiency of the siRNA-loaded nanocarriers is assessed with 4T1 cells stably expressing luciferase (fluc-4T1) and further, with a fluc-4T1 xenograft model. Significant down-regulation of luciferase is observed, and unlike high-molecular-weight analogues, the Alkyl-PEI2k-coated IOs show good biocompatibility.

Thus to date, the diagnosis of bacterial infections continues to rely on the performance of time-consuming microbiological cultures. Here, we demonstrate the use of bioorthogonal chemistry for magnetically labeling specific pathogens to enable their subsequent detection by nuclear magnetic resonance. Antibodies against a bacterial target of interest were first modified with trans-cyclooctene and then coupled to tetrazine-modified magnetic nanoprobes, directly on the bacteria. This labeling method was verified by surface plasmon resonance as well as by highly specific detection of Staphylococcus aureus using a miniaturized diagnostic magnetic resonance system. Compared to other copper-free bioorthogonal chemistries, the cycloaddition reaction reported here displayed faster kinetics and yielded higher labeling efficiency. Considering the short assay times and the portability of the necessary instrumentation, it is feasible that this approach could be adapted for clinical use in resource-limited settings.</abstract><notes>Liong, Monty; Fernandez-Suarez, Marta; Issadore, David; Min, Changwook; Tassa, Carlos; Reiner, Thomas; Fortune, Sarah M; Toner, Mehmet; Lee, Hakho; Weissleder, Ralph; HHSN268201000044C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; HHSN268201000044C/PHS HHS/; P41 EB002503/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; P41 EB002503-08/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626-07/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626-08/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB010011-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB010011-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01-EB00462605A1/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01-EB010011/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; T32 CA079443-11A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32CA79443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Bioconjug Chem. 2011 Dec 21;22(12):2390-4.

Although their levels often change over time, their measurement is often constrained to a single time point. Cumulative biomarker exposure would provide a fundamentally different kind of measurement to what is available in the clinic. Magnetic resonance relaxometry can be used to noninvasively monitor changes in the relaxation properties of antibody-coated magnetic particles when they aggregate upon exposure to a biomarker of interest. We used implantable devices containing such sensors to continuously profile changes in three clinically relevant cardiac biomarkers at physiological levels for up to 72 h. Sensor response differed between experimental and control groups in a mouse model of myocardial infarction and correlated with infarct size. Our prototype for a biomarker monitoring device also detected doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and can be adapted to detect other molecular biomarkers with a sensitivity as low as the pg/ml range.</abstract><notes>Ling, Yibo; Pong, Terrence; Vassiliou, Christophoros C; Huang, Paul L; Cima, Michael J; 5 U54 CA119349-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA151844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 NS033335-17/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS033335-18/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; Nat Biotechnol. 2011 Mar;29(3):273-7.

One major barrier to the use of PSCs is their potential risk for tumor initiation following differentiation and transplantation in vivo. In the current study we sought to evaluate the role of the tumor suppressor Pten in murine PSC neoplastic progression. Using eight functional assays that have previously been used to indicate PSC adaptation or transformation, Pten null embryonic stem cells (ESCs) failed to rate as significant in five of them. Instead, our data demonstrate that the loss of Pten causes the emergence of a small number of aggressive, teratoma-initiating embryonic carcinoma cells (ECCs) during differentiation in vitro, while the remaining 90-95% of differentiated cells are non-tumorigenic. Furthermore, our data show that the mechanism by which Pten null ECCs emerge in vitro and cause tumors in vivo is through increased survival and self-renewal, due to failed repression of the transcription factor Nanog.</abstract><notes>Lindgren, Anne G; Natsuhara, Kyle; Tian, E; Vincent, John J; Li, Xinmin; Jiao, Jing; Wu, Hong; Banerjee, Utpal; Clark, Amander T; P01 P01GM081621/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 1R01HD058047-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/; PLoS One. 2011 Jan 27;6(1):e16478.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21304588</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3029365</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0016478</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1002</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1002</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, X.</author><author>Xie, J.</author><author>Zhu, L.</author><author>Lee, S.</author><author>Niu, G.</author><author>Ma, Y.</author><author>Kim, K.</author><author>Chen, X.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Laboratory of Molecular Imaging and Nanomedicine, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, National Institutes of Health, USA.</auth-address><titles><title>Hybrid ferritin nanoparticles as activatable probes for tumor imaging</title><secondary-title>Angew Chem Int Ed Engl</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Angew Chem Int Ed Engl</full-title><abbr-1>Angewandte Chemie (International ed</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1569-72</pages><volume>50</volume><number>7</number><edition>2011/02/11</edition><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Diagnostic Imaging</keyword><keyword>Ferritins/*chemistry</keyword><keyword>Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Head and Neck Neoplasms/*diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Hydrogen-Ion Concentration</keyword><keyword>Matrix Metalloproteinase 13/chemistry/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Nanoparticles/*chemistry/diagnostic use</keyword><keyword>Oligopeptides/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Spectrometry, Fluorescence</keyword><keyword>Transplantation, Heterologous</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>Feb 11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1521-3773 (Electronic); 1433-7851 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>21308906</accession-num><notes>Lin, Xin; Xie, Jin; Zhu, Lei; Lee, Seulki; Niu, Gang; Ma, Ying; Kim, Kwangmeyung; Chen, Xiaoyuan; Germany; International ed. in English; Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2011 Feb 11;50(7):1569-72. doi: 10.1002/anie.201006757.

One challenge, however, has been to achieve precise control in loading multiple functionalities. Traditional bioconjugation techniques, which randomly target the surface functional groups of nanomaterials, have been found increasingly inadequate for such control, which is a drawback that may substantially slow down or prohibit the translational efforts. In the current study, we evaluated ferritin nanocages as candidate nanoplatforms for multifunctional loading. Ferritin nanocages can be either genetically or chemically modified to impart functionalities to their surfaces, and metal cations can be encapsulated in their interiors by association with metal binding sites. Moreover, different types of ferritin nanocages can be disassembled under acidic condition and reassembled at pH of 7.4, providing a facile way to achieve function hybridization. We were able to use combinations of these unique properties to produce a number of multifunctional ferritin nanostructures with precise control of their composition. We then studied these nanoparticles, both in vitro and in vivo, to evaluate their potential suitability as multimodality imaging probes. A good tumor targeting profile was observed, which was attributable to both the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and biovector mediated targeting. This, in combination with the generalizability of the function loading techniques, promises ferritin particles as a powerful nanoplatfom in the era of nanomedicine.</abstract><notes>Lin, Xin; Xie, Jin; Niu, Gang; Zhang, Fan; Gao, Haokao; Yang, Min; Quan, Qimeng; Aronova, Maria A; Zhang, Guofeng; Lee, Seulki; Leapman, Richard; Chen, Xiaoyuan; Z99 EB999999/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; ZIA EB000073-01/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Nano Lett. 2011 Feb 9;11(2):814-9.

We used nanoparticle-encapsulated curcumin to treat medulloblastoma and glioblastoma cells. This formulation caused a dose-dependent decrease in growth of multiple brain tumor cell cultures, including the embryonal tumor derived lines DAOY and D283Med, and the glioblastoma neurosphere lines HSR-GBM1 and JHH-GBM14. The reductions in viable cell mass observed were associated with a combination of G(2)/M arrest and apoptotic induction. Curcumin also significantly decreased anchorage-independent clonogenic growth and reduced the CD133-positive stem-like population. Down-regulation of the insulin-like growth factor pathway in DAOY medulloblastoma cells was observed, providing one possible mechanism for the changes. Levels of STAT3 were also attenuated.

Several studies have reported that the mechanical rigidity of a hydrogel plays a significant role in regulating the phenotypes of cancer cells adhered to the gel surface. This finding suggests that matrix rigidity should also modulate the malignancy of 3D tumor spheroids. However, the role of matrix stiffness is often confounded by concurrent changes in 3D matrix permeability. This study reports an advanced strategy to assemble 3D liver tumor spheroids with controlled intercellular organization, phenotypes, and angiogenic activities using hydrogels with controlled stiffness and minimal differences in molecular diffusivity. The elastic moduli of cell-encapsulated collagen gels were increased by stiffening interconnected collagen fibers with varied amounts of poly(ethylene glycol) di-(succinic acid N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester). Interestingly, hepatocellular carcinoma cells encapsulated in a fat-like, softer hydrogel formed malignant cancer spheroids, while cells cultured in a liver-like, stiffer gel formed compact hepatoids with suppressed malignancy. Overall, both the hydrogel and the 3D tumor spheroids developed in this study will be greatly useful to better understand and regulate the emergent behaviors of various cancer cells.</abstract><notes>Liang, Youyun&#xD;Jeong, Jaehyun&#xD;DeVolder, Ross J&#xD;Cha, Chaenyung&#xD;Wang, Fei&#xD;Tong, Yen Wah&#xD;Kong, Hyunjoon&#xD;England&#xD;Biomaterials. 2011 Dec;32(35):9308-15.

However, it remains a challenge to attain desired delivery rate at injection sites due to local tissue pressures exerted on the soft hydrogels. Furthermore, there is often limited controllability of stiffness and degradation rates, which are key factors required for achieving desired drug release rate and therapeutic efficacy. This study presents a stiff and metastable poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA)-poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) hydrogel which exhibits an elastic modulus equivalent to bulk plastic materials, and controllable degradation rate independent of its initial elastic modulus. Such unique stiffness was attained from the highly branched architecture of PEI, and the decoupled controllability of degradation rate was achieved by tuning the non-equilibrium swelling of the hydrogel. Furthermore, a single intramuscular administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF)-encapsulated PEGDA-PEI hydrogel extended the mobilization of mononuclear cells to four days. A larger yield of expanded CD34+ and CD31+ endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) was also obtained as compared to the daily bolus administration. Overall, the hydrogel created in this study will be useful for the controlled and sustained delivery of a wide array of drug molecules.</abstract><notes>Liang, Youyun&#xD;Jensen, Tor W&#xD;Roy, Edward J&#xD;Cha, Chaenyung&#xD;Devolder, Ross J&#xD;Kohman, Richie E&#xD;Zhang, Bao Zhong&#xD;Textor, Kyle B&#xD;Rund, Lauretta A&#xD;Schook, Lawrence B&#xD;Tong, Yen Wah&#xD;Kong, Hyunjoon&#xD;1 R21 HL097314 A/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 HL097314-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Biomaterials. 2011 Mar;32(7):2004-12.

In such conditions, precise targeting of these cells could be therapeutically beneficial while sparing many essential functions of the innate immune system, thus limiting unwanted effects. Inflammatory monocytes-but not the noninflammatory subset-depend on the chemokine receptor CCR2 for localization to injured tissue. Here we present an optimized lipid nanoparticle and a CCR2-silencing short interfering RNA that, when administered systemically in mice, show rapid blood clearance, accumulate in spleen and bone marrow, and localize to monocytes. Efficient degradation of CCR2 mRNA in monocytes prevents their accumulation in sites of inflammation. Specifically, the treatment attenuates their number in atherosclerotic plaques, reduces infarct size after coronary artery occlusion, prolongs normoglycemia in diabetic mice after pancreatic islet transplantation, and results in reduced tumor volumes and lower numbers of tumor-associated macrophages.</abstract><notes>Leuschner, Florian; Dutta, Partha; Gorbatov, Rostic; Novobrantseva, Tatiana I; Donahoe, Jessica S; Courties, Gabriel; Lee, Kang Mi; Kim, James I; Markmann, James F; Marinelli, Brett; Panizzi, Peter; Lee, Won Woo; Iwamoto, Yoshiko; Milstein, Stuart; Epstein-Barash, Hila; Cantley, William; Wong, Jamie; Cortez-Retamozo, Virna; Newton, Andita; Love, Kevin; Libby, Peter; Pittet, Mikael J; Swirski, Filip K; Koteliansky, Victor; Langer, Robert; Weissleder, Ralph; Anderson, Daniel G; Nahrendorf, Matthias; 268201000044C/PHS HHS/; HHSN268201000044C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; P50 CA086355-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA086355-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50-CA86355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA115527-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA132091-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 EB006432/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB006432-04/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB006432-06/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 HL095612-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL095629-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL095629-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL096576/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL096576-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL096576-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01-CA115527/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01-CA132091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01-EB006432/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01-HL095629/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01-HL096576/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R37 EB000244-33/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R37-EB000244/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; T32 CA079443-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA079443-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32-CA79443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U24 CA092782-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U24-CA92782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Nat Biotechnol. 2011 Oct 9;29(11):1005-10. doi: 10.1038/nbt.1989.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21983520</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3212614</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nbt.1989</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>485</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">485</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Y.

Although computed tomographic (CT) imaging is near optimal from a contrast perspective, the rapid respiration rate, limited temporal resolution, and inflexible x-ray pulse control of most micro-CT scanners limit their utility in pulmonary imaging. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have permitted the development of field emission cathodes, with rapid switching and precise pulse control. The goal of this study was to explore the utility of a CNT-based micro-CT system for application in quantitative pulmonary imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve CB57/B6 mice were imaged during peak inspiration and end-exhalation using the CNT micro-CT system. The respiratory trace was derived from a sensor placed underneath the abdomen of the animal. Animals were allowed to breathe freely during the imaging under isoflurane anesthesia. Images were reconstructed using isotropic voxels of 77-mum resolution (50 kVp, 400 projections, 30-ms x-ray pulse). Lung volumes were measured with region-growing techniques and thresholds derived from the surrounding air and soft tissues. Basic functional parameters, including tidal volume, functional reserve capacity and minute volume, were also calculated. RESULTS: The average scan time was 13.4 +/- 1.8 minutes for each phase of the respiratory cycle. Mean lung volumes at peak inspiration and end-expiration were 0.23 +/- 0.026 and 0.11 +/- 0.024 mL, respectively. The average minute volume was 11.93 +/- 2.64 mL/min. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate the utility of a CNT-based micro-CT system in acquiring prospectively gated images from free-breathing mice for obtaining physiologic data. This technique provides an alternative to breath-hold techniques requiring intubation and offers greater dose efficiency than retrospective gating techniques.</abstract><notes>Lee, Yueh Z; Burk, Laurel M; Wang, Ko-han; Cao, Guohua; Volmer, Jonathan; Lu, Jianping; Zhou, Otto; 4R33EB004204-01/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; U54 CA151652-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Acad Radiol. 2011 May;18(5):588-93.

For enhanced therapeutic efficacy to be achieved with such platforms, a tumor-specific drug-release trigger is a critical requirement. This article reports the use of a pH-sensitive polymer network that surrounds a nanoscale liposome core to trigger the release of both encapsulated hydrophilic, membrane-impermeable Ni(II) cations and amphipathic, membrane-permeable As(III) anticancer agents under acidic conditions commonly encountered in hypoxic tumor tissues and late endosomes. Computational modeling studies provide clear evidence that the acid-triggered drug-release mechanism for this polymer-caged nanobin (PCN) platform arises from a pH- and temperature-responsive conformation change of the cross-linked polymer cage. As a result, the simultaneous release of both of the active agents in this multicomponent therapeutic enhances the pro-apoptotic activity of As(III) while diminishing its acute toxicity, potentially reducing the undesirable side effects commonly associated with this free drug. The ability to engender acid-triggered release of drugs co-encapsulated inside a liposomal template makes drug delivery using PCN an attractive strategy for triggered drug release.</abstract><notes>Lee, Sang-Min; Lee, One-Sun; O&apos;Halloran, Thomas V; Schatz, George C; Nguyen, Sonbinh T; P30CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01CA151461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA119341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2011 May 24;5(5):3961-9.

Stem cells generally have been thought to maintain low levels of ROS as a protection against these processes. However, recent studies suggest that ROS can also play roles as second messengers, activating normal cellular processes. Here, we investigated ROS function in primary brain-derived neural progenitors. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that proliferative, self-renewing multipotent neural progenitors with the phenotypic characteristics of neural stem cells (NSC) maintained a high ROS status and were highly responsive to ROS stimulation. ROS-mediated enhancements in self-renewal and neurogenesis were dependent on PI3K/Akt signaling. Pharmacological or genetic manipulations that diminished cellular ROS levels also interfered with normal NSC and/or multipotent progenitor function both in vitro and in vivo. This study has identified a redox-mediated regulatory mechanism of NSC function that may have significant implications for brain injury, disease, and repair.</abstract><notes>Le Belle, Janel E; Orozco, Nicolas M; Paucar, Andres A; Saxe, Jonathan P; Mottahedeh, Jack; Pyle, April D; Wu, Hong; Kornblum, Harley I; AI-28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/; CA-16042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; MH65756/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/; P50-HD-055784/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/; R01 MH065756-04/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/; R01 MH065756-05/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/; R01 MH065756-06/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/; Cell Stem Cell. 2011 Jan 7;8(1):59-71.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21211782</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3018289</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.stem.2010.11.028</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1275</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1275</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lausted, C.</author><author>Hu, Z.</author><author>Hood, L.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA, USA. clausted@systemsbiology.org</auth-address><titles><title>Label-free detection with surface plasmon resonance imaging</title><secondary-title>Methods Mol Biol</secondary-title></titles><pages>321-33</pages><volume>723</volume><edition>2011/03/04</edition><keywords><keyword>Antibodies/immunology</keyword><keyword>Chromans/pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Culture Media/metabolism</keyword><keyword>Hep G2 Cells</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Printing</keyword><keyword>Protein Array Analysis</keyword><keyword>Proteins/*analysis/immunology/secretion</keyword><keyword>Surface Plasmon Resonance/*methods</keyword><keyword>Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>1940-6029 (Electronic)&#xD;1064-3745 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>21370074</accession-num><abstract>Sensors based on surface plasmon resonance have demonstrated, over the last 2 decades, to be an effective method of studying biomolecular interactions without the need for labeling.

No alteration of the cell viability is found after 1 h of incubation, but toxicity increases significantly after 3 d, probably due to the noxious effect of the released methanol. Anticancer drugs temozolomide and doxorubicin are encapsulated in the NPs with 20-40% efficiency, and their release is monitored using in vitro essays.

To identify potential therapeutic targets to overcome this fibrosis, we examined the interplay between fibrosis and the key proteinase membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14), which is required for growth and invasion in the collagen-rich microenvironment. In this article, we show that compared with control mice (Kras(+)/MT1-MMP(-)) that express an activating Kras(G12D) mutation necessary for pancreatic cancer development, littermate mice that express both MT1-MMP and Kras(G12D) (Kras(+)/MT1-MMP(+)) developed a greater number of large, dysplastic mucin-containing papillary lesions. These lesions were associated with a significant amount of surrounding fibrosis, increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (+) cells in the stroma, indicative of activated myofibroblasts, and increased Smad2 phosphorylation. To further understand how MT1-MMP promotes fibrosis, we established an in vitro model to examine the effect of expressing MT1-MMP in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells on stellate cell collagen deposition. Conditioned media from MT1-MMP-expressing PDAC cells grown in three-dimensional collagen enhanced Smad2 nuclear translocation, promoted Smad2 phosphorylation, and increased collagen production by stellate cells. Inhibiting the activity or expression of the TGF-beta type I receptor in stellate cells attenuated MT1-MMP conditioned medium-induced collagen expression by stellate cells. In addition, a function-blocking anti-TGF-beta antibody also inhibited MT1-MMP conditioned medium-induced collagen expression in stellate cells. Overall, we show that the bona fide collagenase MT1-MMP paradoxically contributes to fibrosis by increasing TGF-beta signaling and that targeting MT1-MMP may thus help to mitigate fibrosis.</abstract><notes>Krantz, Seth B&#xD;Shields, Mario A&#xD;Dangi-Garimella, Surabhi&#xD;Cheon, Eric C&#xD;Barron, Morgan R&#xD;Hwang, Rosa F&#xD;Rao, M Sambasiva&#xD;Grippo, Paul J&#xD;Bentrem, David J&#xD;Munshi, Hidayatullah G&#xD;R01 CA126888-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA126888-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA126888-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA126888-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA126888-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01CA126888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Mol Cancer Res. 2011 Oct;9(10):1294-304.

The development of effective therapeutic strategies using tumor-targeted cells requires the ability to determine in vivo the location, distribution, and long-term viability of the therapeutic cell populations as well as their biological fate with respect to cell activation and differentiation. In conjunction with various noninvasive imaging modalities, cell-labeling methods, such as exogenous labeling or transfection with a reporter gene, allow visualization of labeled cells in vivo in real time, as well as monitoring and quantifying cell accumulation and function. Such cell-tracking methods also have an important role in basic cancer research, where they serve to elucidate novel biological mechanisms. In this Review, we describe the basic principles of cell-tracking methods, explain various approaches to cell tracking, and highlight recent examples for the application of such methods in animals and humans.</abstract><notes>Kircher, Moritz F; Gambhir, Sanjiv S; Grimm, Jan; England; Nature reviews.

However, the effect of Src silencing on other Src family kinases (SFKs) is not known. We hypothesized that other SFK members could compensate for the lack of Src activity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cell viability after either Src or Fgr silencing was examined in ovarian cancer cell lines by MTT assay. Expression of SFKs after Src silencing in ovarian cancer cells was examined by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Therapeutic effect of in vivo Src and/or Fgr silencing was examined using siRNA incorporated into chitosan nanoparticles (siRNA/CH-NP). Microvessel density, cell proliferation, and apoptosis markers were determined by immunohistochemical staining in ovarian tumor tissues. RESULTS: Src silencing enhanced cytotoxicity of docetaxel in both SKOV3ip1 and HeyA8 cells. In addition, Src silencing using siRNA/CH-NP in combination with docetaxel resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth compared with control siRNA/CH-NP (81.8% reduction in SKOV3ip1, P = 0.017; 84.3% reduction in HeyA8, P &lt; 0.005). These effects were mediated by decreased tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and increased tumor cell apoptosis. Next, we assessed the effects of Src silencing on other SFK members in ovarian cancer cell lines. Src silencing resulted in significantly increased Fgr levels. Dual Src and Fgr silencing in vitro resulted in increased apoptosis that was mediated by increased caspase and AKT activity. In addition, dual silencing of Src and Fgr in vivo using siRNA/CH-NP resulted in the greatest reduction in tumor growth compared with silencing of either Src or Fgr alone in the HeyA8 model (68.8%, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, in addition to Src, Fgr plays a biologically significant role in ovarian cancer growth and might represent an important target.</abstract><notes>Kim, Hye-Sun; Han, Hee Dong; Armaiz-Pena, Guillermo N; Stone, Rebecca L; Nam, Eun Ji; Lee, Jeong-Won; Shahzad, Mian M K; Nick, Alpa M; Lee, Sun Joo; Roh, Ju-Won; Nishimura, Masato; Mangala, Lingegowda S; Bottsford-Miller, Justin; Gallick, Gary E; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K; CA 109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA 110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA 128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; HD050128/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/; K12 HD050128-05/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA109298-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA110793-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128797-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2 GM 092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; RC2 GM092599-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; T32 CA101642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA101642-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Apr 1;17(7):1713-21.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of u-PAR was studied in 162 epithelial ovarian cancers, including 77 pairs of corresponding primary and metastatic tumors. The effect of an antibody against u-PAR (ATN-658) on proliferation, adhesion, invasion, apoptosis, and migration was assessed in 3 (SKOV3ip1, HeyA8, and CaOV3) ovarian cancer cell lines. The impact of the u-PAR antibody on tumor weight, number, and survival was examined in corresponding ovarian cancer xenograft models and the mechanism by which ATN-658 blocks metastasis was explored. RESULTS: Only 8% of all ovarian tumors were negative for u-PAR expression. Treatment of SKOV3ip1, HeyA8, and CaOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines with the u-PAR antibody inhibited cell invasion, migration, and adhesion. In vivo, anti-u-PAR treatment reduced the number of tumors and tumor weight in CaOV3 and SKOV3ip1 xenografts and reduced tumor weight and increased survival in HeyA8 xenografts. Immunostaining of CaOV3 xenograft tumors and ovarian cancer cell lines showed an increase in active-caspase 3 and TUNEL staining. Treatment with u-PAR antibody inhibited alpha(5)-integrin and u-PAR colocalization on primary human omental extracellular matrix. Anti-u-PAR treatment also decreased the expression of urokinase, u-PAR, beta(3)-integrin, and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that an antibody against u-PAR reduces metastasis, induces apoptosis, and reduces the interaction between u-PAR and alpha(5)-integrin. This provides a rationale for targeting the u-PAR pathway in patients with ovarian cancer and for further testing of ATN-658 in this indication.</abstract><notes>Kenny, Hilary A; Leonhardt, Payton; Ladanyi, Andras; Yamada, S Diane; Montag, Anthony; Im, Hae Kyung; Jagadeeswaran, Sujatha; Shaw, David E; Mazar, Andrew P; Lengyel, Ernst; K99 CA134750-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; K99CA134750/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA111882-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA111882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Feb 1;17(3):459-71.

However, because of a lack of specific imaging agents, we continue to have a poor understanding of their absolute numbers, flux rates, and functional states in different tissues. Here, we describe a new macrophage specific positron emission tomography imaging agent, labeled with zirconium-89 ((89)Zr), that was based on a cross-linked, short chain dextran nanoparticle (13 nm). Following systemic administration, the particle demonstrated a vascular half-life of 3.9 h and was found to be located primarily in tissue resident macrophages rather than other white blood cells. Subsequent imaging of the probe using a xenograft mouse model of cancer allowed for quantitation of tumor-associated macrophage numbers, which are of major interest in emerging molecular targeting strategies. It is likely that the material described, which allows the visualization of macrophage biology in vivo, will likewise be useful for a multitude of human applications.</abstract><notes>Keliher, Edmund J; Yoo, Jeongsoo; Nahrendorf, Matthias; Lewis, Jason S; Marinelli, Brett; Newton, Andita; Pittet, Mikael J; Weissleder, Ralph; HHSN268201000044C/PHS HHS/; P50 CA86355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U24 CA092782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA126515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Bioconjug Chem. 2011 Dec 21;22(12):2383-9.

Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of 12 conjugatable tetrazines. The tetrazines were all synthesized in a similar fashion and were screened in parallel to identify candidates most ideally suited for biological studies. In depth follow-up studies revealed compounds with varying degrees of stability and reactivity that could each be useful in different bioorthogonal applications. One promising, highly stable, and water-soluble derivative was used in pretargeted cancer cell labeling studies, confirming its utility as a bioorthogonal moiety.</abstract><notes>Karver, Mark R; Weissleder, Ralph; Hilderbrand, Scott A; P50 CA086355-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50CA86355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626-08/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB010011-01A1/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB010011-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01EB010011/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Bioconjug Chem. 2011 Nov 16;22(11):2263-70.

Magnetic resonance imaging is a tomographic technique with high temporal and spatial resolution and represents an excellent imaging modality for longitudinal noninvasive assessment of biomaterials in vivo. To distinguish biomaterials from surrounding tissues for magnetic resonance imaging, protein polymer contrast agents were developed and incorporated into hydrogels. In vitro and in vivo images of protein polymer hydrogels, with and without covalently incorporated protein polymer contrast agents, were acquired by magnetic resonance imaging. T(1) values of the labeled gels were consistently lower when protein polymer contrast agents were included. As a result, the protein polymer contrast agent hydrogels facilitated fate tracking, quantification of degradation, and detection of immune response in vivo. For the duration of the in vivo study, the protein polymer contrast agent-containing hydrogels could be distinguished from adjacent tissues and from the foreign body response surrounding the gels. The hydrogels containing protein polymer contrast agent have a contrast-to-noise ratio 2-fold greater than hydrogels without protein polymer contrast agent. In the absence of the protein polymer contrast agent, hydrogels cannot be distinguished by the end of the gel lifetime.</abstract><notes>Karfeld-Sulzer, Lindsay S&#xD;Waters, Emily A&#xD;Kohlmeir, Ellen K&#xD;Kissler, Hermann&#xD;Zhang, Xiaomin&#xD;Kaufman, Dixon B&#xD;Barron, Annelise E&#xD;Meade, Thomas J&#xD;2-T32-GM008449/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;5 U54 CA119341-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB003806-01/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB005866-01/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB005866-06/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01EB003806/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01EB005866/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;T32 GM008449-11/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119341-040003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Magn Reson Med. 2011 Jan;65(1):220-8.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20740653</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2995002</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/mrm.22587</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>120</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">120</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kar, A. </author><author>Fushimi, K. </author><author>Zhou, X.</author><author>Ray, P.</author><author>Shi, C. </author><author>Chen, X. </author><author>Liu, Z.</author><author>Chen, S. </author><author>Wu, J.

One of the cis elements regulating tau alternative splicing is a stem-loop structure at the 5&apos; splice site of tau exon 10. The RNA helicase(s) modulating this stem-loop structure was unknown. We searched for splicing regulators interacting with this stem-loop region using an RNA affinity pulldown-coupled mass spectrometry approach and identified DDX5/RNA helicase p68 as an activator of tau exon 10 splicing. The activity of p68 in stimulating tau exon 10 inclusion is dependent on RBM4, an intronic splicing activator. RNase H cleavage and U1 protection assays suggest that p68 promotes conformational change of the stem-loop structure, thereby increasing the access of U1snRNP to the 5&apos; splice site of tau exon 10. This study reports the first RNA helicase interacting with a stem-loop structure at the splice site and regulating alternative splicing in a helicase-dependent manner. Our work uncovers a previously unknown function of p68 in regulating tau exon 10 splicing. Furthermore, our experiments reveal functional interaction between two splicing activators for tau exon 10, p68 binding at the stem-loop region and RBM4 interacting with the intronic splicing enhancer region.</abstract><notes>Kar, Amar; Fushimi, Kazuo; Zhou, Xiaohong; Ray, Payal; Shi, Chen; Chen, Xiaoping; Liu, Zhiren; Chen, She; Wu, Jane Y; United States; Molecular and cellular biology; Mol Cell Biol. 2011 May;31(9):1812-21.

The inductive factors involved in lesion formation are unknown. We found that the expression of the neuro-inflammatory factor Substance P (SP) is dramatically increased in early lesional tissue in patients who have either fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) or acquired HO, and in three independent mouse models of HO. In Nse-BMP4, a mouse model of HO, robust HO forms in response to tissue injury; however, null mutations of the preprotachykinin (PPT) gene encoding SP prevent HO. Importantly, ablation of SP(+) sensory neurons, treatment with an antagonist of SP receptor NK1r, deletion of NK1r gene, or genetic down-regulation of NK1r-expressing mast cells also profoundly inhibit injury-induced HO. These observations establish a potent neuro-inflammatory induction and amplification circuit for BMP-dependent HO lesion formation, and identify novel molecular targets for prevention of HO.</abstract><notes>Kan, Lixin; Lounev, Vitali Y; Pignolo, Robert J; Duan, Lishu; Liu, Yijie; Stock, Stuart R; McGuire, Tammy L; Lu, Bao; Gerard, Norma P; Shore, Eileen M; Kaplan, Frederick S; Kessler, John A; NS20013/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; NS20778/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS020013-27/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS020778/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS020778-26/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01-AR041916/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/; J Cell Biochem. 2011 Oct;112(10):2759-72. doi: 10.1002/jcb.23259.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21748788</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jcb.23259</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1202</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1202</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jung, J.

The natural complexity of ECMs has limited cell-matrix investigations predominantly to experiments where only one matrix component is adjusted at a time, making it difficult to uncover interactions between different matrix components or to efficiently determine optimal matrix compositions for specific desired biological responses. Here we have developed modular synthetic ECMs based on peptide self-assembly whose incorporation of multiple different peptide ligands can be adjusted. The peptides can co-assemble in a wide range of combinations to form hydrogels of uniform morphology and consistent mechanical properties, but with precisely varied mixtures of peptide ligands. The modularity of this system in turn enabled multi-factorial experimental designs for investigating interactions between these ligands and for determining a multi-peptide matrix formulation that maximized endothelial cell growth. In cultures of HUVECs, we observed a previously unknown antagonistic interaction between the laminin-derived peptide YIGSR and RGDS-mediated cell attachment and growth. We also identified an optimized combination of self-assembled peptides bearing the ligands RGDS and IKVAV that led to endothelial cell growth equivalent to that on native full-length fibronectin. Both of these findings would have been challenging to uncover using more traditional one-factor-at-a-time analyses.</abstract><notes>Jung, Jangwook P&#xD;Moyano, Jose V&#xD;Collier, Joel H&#xD;1R01EB009701/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;7R21EB007335/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB009701/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB009701-01/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB009701-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB009701-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB009701-04/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Integr Biol (Camb). 2011 Mar;3(3):185-96.

Specifically, triangular gold nanoprisms, densely functionalized with oligonucleotide ligands, hybridize to complementary particles with an affinity that is several million times higher than that of spherical nanoparticle conjugates functionalized with the same amount of DNA. In addition, they exhibit association rates that are 2 orders of magnitude greater than those of their spherical counterparts. This phenomenon stems from the ability of the flat, extended facets of nonspherical nanoparticles to (1) support more numerous ligand interactions through greater surface contact with complementary particles, (2) increase the effective local concentration of terminal DNA nucleotides that mediate hybridization, and (3) relieve the conformational stresses imposed on nanoparticle-bound ligands participating in interactions between curved surfaces. Finally, these same trends are observed for the pH-mediated association of nanoparticles functionalized with carboxylate ligands, demonstrating the generality of these findings.</abstract><notes>Jones, Matthew R; Macfarlane, Robert J; Prigodich, Andrew E; Patel, Pinal C; Mirkin, Chad A; J Am Chem Soc. 2011 Nov 23;133(46):18865-9.

We found that HeyL, contrary to the classic function of Hes and Hey factors, promotes neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells both in culture and in the embryonic brain in vivo. Furthermore, null mutation of HeyL decreased the rate of neuronal differentiation of cultured neural progenitor cells. HeyL binds to and activates the promoter of the proneural gene neurogenin2, which is inhibited by other Hes and Hey family members, and HeyL is a weak inhibitor of the Hes1 promoter. HeyL is able to bind other Hes and Hey family members, but it cannot bind the Groucho/Tle1 transcriptional corepressor, which mediates the inhibitory effects of the Hes family of factors. Furthermore, although HeyL expression is only weakly augmented by Notch signaling, we found that bone morphogenic protein signaling increases HeyL expression by neural progenitor cells. These observations suggest that HeyL promotes neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells by activating proneural genes and by inhibiting the actions of other Hes and Hey family members.</abstract><notes>Jalali, Ali; Bassuk, Alexander G; Kan, Lixin; Israsena, Nipan; Mukhopadhyay, Abhishek; McGuire, Tammy; Kessler, John A; K08 NS048174-05/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; K08-NS48174/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS020013-25A2/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS020013-26/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS020013-27/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS020778-25/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS020778-26/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01-NS20013/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01-NS20778/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; J Neurosci Res. 2011 Mar;89(3):299-309. doi: 10.1002/jnr.22562.

Although the principle of adjusting treatment to specific patient characteristics has since been the strategy of physicians, this is undermined by a population-biased approach to drug development. Therefore, it is generally true to say that our current evidential approach to cancer treatment is driven more by drug-regulation requirements and market considerations than the specific needs of an individual patient. But, with cancer drug costs now spiraling out of control and the modest efficacy typically seen in patients, the community is again turning to Hippocrates&apos; ancient paradigm--this time with emphasis on molecular considerations. Rapidly evolving technologies are empowering us to describe the molecular &apos;nature&apos; of a patient and/or tumor and with this has come the beginning of truly personalized medicine, with maximized efficacy, cost effectiveness and hopefully improved survival for the patient.</abstract><notes>Jackson, David B; Sood, Anil K; CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2011 Oct 11;8(12):735-41. doi: 10.1038/nrclinonc.2011.151.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21989071</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrclinonc.2011.151</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>735</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">735</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Issadore, D.</author><author>Shao, H.</author><author>Chung, J. </author><author>Newton, A. </author><author>Pittet, M.</author><author>Weissleder, R. </author><author>Lee, H.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Center for Systems Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 185 Cambridge St, CPZN 5206, Boston, MA 02114, USA.</auth-address><titles><title>Self-assembled magnetic filter for highly efficient immunomagnetic separation</title><secondary-title>Lab Chip</secondary-title><alt-title>Lab on a chip</alt-title></titles><pages>147-51</pages><volume>11</volume><number>1</number><edition>2010/10/16</edition><keywords><keyword>CA151884</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Cell Line, Tumor</keyword><keyword>Equipment Design</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Immunomagnetic Separation/economics/*instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Leukocytes/cytology</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/economics/*instrumentation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>Jan 7</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1473-0189 (Electronic); 1473-0189 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>20949198</accession-num><abstract>We have developed a compact and inexpensive microfluidic chip, the self-assembled magnetic filter, to efficiently remove magnetically tagged cells from suspension. The self-assembled magnetic filter consists of a microfluidic channel built directly above a self-assembled NdFeB magnet. Micrometre-sized grains of NdFeB assemble to form alternating magnetic dipoles, creating a magnetic field with a very strong magnitude B (from the material) and field gradient big dn tri, openB (from the configuration) in the microfluidic channel. The magnetic force imparted on magnetic beads is measured to be comparable to state-of-the-art microfabricated magnets, allowing for efficient separations to be performed in a compact, simple device. The efficiency of the magnetic filter is characterized by sorting non-magnetic (polystyrene) beads from magnetic beads (iron oxide). The filter enriches the population of non-magnetic beads to magnetic beads by a factor of &gt;10(5) with a recovery rate of 90% at 1 mL h(-1). The utility of the magnetic filter is demonstrated with a microfluidic device that sorts tumor cells from leukocytes using negative immunomagnetic selection, and concentrates the tumor cells on an integrated membrane filter for optical detection.</abstract><notes>Issadore, David; Shao, Huilin; Chung, Jaehoon; Newton, Andita; Pittet, Mikael; Weissleder, Ralph; Lee, Hakho; 2R01-EB004626/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626-06/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626-07/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; T32 CA079443-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32-CA79443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 HL080731-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; U01-HL080731/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119349-05S10003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54-CA119349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Lab Chip. 2011 Jan 7;11(1):147-51.

Utilizing a rapidly growing library of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles, DMR has previously been demonstrated as a versatile tool to quantitatively and rapidly detect disease biomarkers in unprocessed biological samples. A major hurdle for bringing DMR to the point-of-care has been its sensitivity to temperature variation. As an alternative to costly and bulky mechanisms to control temperature, we have implemented an automated feedback system to track and compensate for the temperature drift, which enables reliable and robust DMR measurements in realistic clinical environments (4-50 degrees C). Furthermore, the new system interfaces with a mobile device to facilitate system control and data sharing over wireless networks. With such features, the DMR-3 platform can function as a self-contained laboratory even in resource-limited, remote settings. The clinical potential of the new system is demonstrated by detecting trace amounts of proteins and as few as 10 bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) in a short time frame (&lt;30 min).</abstract><notes>Issadore, David; Min, Changwook; Liong, Monty; Chung, Jaehoon; Weissleder, Ralph; Lee, Hakho; 2R01-EB004626/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; HHSN268201000044C/PHS HHS/; R01 EB004626-05A1/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; T32 CA079443-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32-CA79443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119349-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54-CA119349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Lab Chip. 2011 Jul 7;11(13):2282-7.

Here we demonstrate a unique ultrasound triggered vehicle design and fabrication method where the payload and a perfluorocarbon gas microbubble are both encapsulated within the internal aqueous space of a liposome. This nested lipid shell geometry both stabilized the microbubble and ensured it was spatially close enough to interact with the liposome membrane at all times. The internal microbubble was shown to fragment the outer liposome membrane upon exposure to ultrasound at intensities of 1-1.5MPa. The focused ultrasound allowed the release of the internal payload to localized regions within tissue phantoms. The vehicles showed high payload loading efficiency of 16%, stability in blood of several hours, and low level macrophage recognition in vitro. High speed fluorescent videos present the first optical images of such vehicles interacting with ultrasound. This ability to open the outer membrane in small regions of deep tissue could provide a second level of spatial and temporal control beyond biochemical targeting, making these particles promising for in vivo animal studies.</abstract><notes>Ibsen, Stuart&#xD;Benchimol, Michael&#xD;Simberg, Dmitri&#xD;Schutt, Carolyn&#xD;Steiner, Jason&#xD;Esener, Sadik&#xD;5U54CA119335-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P30 CA23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119335-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Netherlands&#xD;J Control Release. 2011 Nov 7;155(3):358-66. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.06.032.

However, technical hurdles hinder the use of common fractionation methods to capture phosphopeptides from complex biological fluids such as human sera. Herein, we present the development of a dual strategy material that offers enhanced capture of low molecular weight phosphoproteins: mesoporous silica thin films with precisely engineered pore sizes that sterically select for molecular size combined with chemically selective surface modifications (i.e. Ga3+, Ti4+ and Zr4+) that target phosphoroproteins. These materials provide high reproducibility (CV=18%) and increase the stability of the captured proteins by excluding degrading enzymes, such as trypsin. The chemical and physical properties of the composite mesoporous thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and ellipsometry. Using mass spectroscopy and biostatistics analysis, the enrichment efficiency of different metal ions immobilized on mesoporous silica chips was investigated. The novel technology reported provides a platform capable of efficiently profiling the serum proteome for biomarker discovery, forensic sampling, and routine diagnostic applications.</abstract><notes>Hu, Ye&#xD;Peng, Yang&#xD;Lin, Kevin&#xD;Shen, Haifa&#xD;Brousseau, Louis C 3rd&#xD;Sakamoto, Jason&#xD;Sun, Tong&#xD;Ferrari, Mauro&#xD;R01CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R21/R33CA122864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Nanoscale. 2011 Feb;3(2):421-8.

In this study, we investigated the clinical and biological significance of Dll4 in ovarian cancer. Dll4 was overexpressed in 72% of tumors examined in which it was an independent predictor of poor survival. Patients with tumors responding to anti-VEGF therapy had lower levels of Dll4 than patients with stable or progressive disease. Under hypoxic conditions, VEGF increased Dll4 expression in the tumor vasculature. Immobilized Dll4 also downregulated VEGFR2 expression in endothelial cells directly through methylation of the VEGFR2 promoter. RNAi-mediated silencing of Dll4 in ovarian tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells inhibited cell growth and angiogenesis, accompanied by induction of hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment. Combining Dll4-targeted siRNA with bevacizumab resulted in greater inhibition of tumor growth, compared with control or treatment with bevacizumab alone. Together, our findings establish that Dll4 plays a functionally important role in both the tumor and endothelial compartments of ovarian cancer and that targeting Dll4 in combination with anti-VEGF treatment might improve outcomes of ovarian cancer treatment.</abstract><notes>Hu, Wei; Lu, Chunhua; Dong, Han Hee; Huang, Jie; Shen, De-yu; Stone, Rebecca L; Nick, Alpa M; Shahzad, Mian M K; Mora, Edna; Jennings, Nicholas B; Lee, Sun Joo; Roh, Ju-Won; Matsuo, Koji; Nishimura, Masato; Goodman, Blake W; Jaffe, Robert B; Langley, Robert R; Deavers, Michael T; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Coleman, Robert L; Sood, Anil K; CA 109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA 110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; HD050128/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA098258-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA109298-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA110793-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128797-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2 GM092599-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; T32 CA101642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA 151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Res. 2011 Sep 15;71(18):6030-9.

The main drawback of such devices in disposable applications is the potential environmental pollution since they are not biodegradable. Biodegradable microfluidic devices have been fabricated out of zein, a prolamin protein found in corn, that can be utilized as disposable health and environmental-friendly micro-chips. Using stereo lithography and soft lithography, micro-chambers and micro-channels features have been replicated on zein films and enclosed zein microfluidic devices are created by bonding to glass substrate using a simple vapor-deposition method. The bonding strength of the zein microfluidic devices has been found to exceed the tensile strength of the zein film and hydraulic pressure, and fluid flow through large-area complex microfluidic designs shows no leakage or distortion. High optical clarity and fluorescent imaging in the zein microfluidic devices are demonstrated by visualizing micro-particles and Rhodamine B. Zein microfluidic devices enable truly disposable microfluidics with intrinsic biocompatibility and biodegradability that can be fabricated using existing techniques.</abstract><notes>Hsiao, Austin; Luecha, Jarupat; Kokini, Jozef; Liu, Logan; Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc. 2011;2011:8400-3.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22256296</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6092072</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>923</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">923</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hsiao, A.</author><author>Hunter, M.</author><author>Greiner, C.</author><author>Gupta, S.</author><author>Georgakoudi, I.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>Tufts University, Biomedical Engineering Department, Medford, Massachusetts 02115, USA.</auth-address><titles><title>Noninvasive identification of subcellular organization and nuclear morphology features associated with leukemic cells using light-scattering spectroscopy</title><secondary-title>J Biomed Opt</secondary-title><alt-title>Journal of biomedical optics</alt-title></titles><pages>037007</pages><volume>16</volume><number>3</number><edition>2011/04/05</edition><keywords><keyword>Cell Line, Tumor</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus/*pathology</keyword><keyword>Cellular Structures/pathology</keyword><keyword>Fractals</keyword><keyword>Granulocytes/cytology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Light</keyword><keyword>Lymphocytes/cytology</keyword><keyword>Microscopy, Interference</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological</keyword><keyword>Optical Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology</keyword><keyword>Reference Values</keyword><keyword>*Scattering, Radiation</keyword><keyword>Spectrum Analysis/*methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>Mar</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1560-2281 (Electronic); 1083-3668 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>21456879</accession-num><abstract>Leukemia is the most common and deadly cancer among children and one of the most prevalent cancers among adults. Improvements in its diagnosis and monitoring of leukemic patients could have a significant impact in their long-term treatment. We demonstrate that light-scattering spectroscopy (LSS)-based approaches could serve as a tool to achieve this goal. Specifically, we characterize the light scattering properties of leukemic (NALM-6) cells and compare them to those of normal lymphocytes and granulocytes in the 440-710 nm range, over +/-4 deg about the exact backscattering direction. We find that the LSS spectra are well described by an inverse power-law wavelength dependence, with a power exponent insensitive to the scattering angle but significantly higher for leukemic cells than for normal leukocytes. This is consistent with differences in the subcellular morphology of these cells, detected in differential interference contrast images. Furthermore, the residual light-scattering signal, extracted after subtracting the inverse power-law fit from the data, can be analyzed assuming a Gaussian distribution of spherical scatterers using Mie theory. This analysis yields scatterer sizes that are consistent with the diameters of cell nuclei and allows the detection of the larger nuclei of NALM-6 cells compared to those of lymphocytes and granulocytes.</abstract><notes>Hsiao, Austin; Hunter, Martin; Greiner, Cherry; Gupta, Sharad; Georgakoudi, Irene; R21CA114684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Biomed Opt. 2011 Mar;16(3):037007.</notes><work-type>Evaluation Studies; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21456879</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3081866</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/1.3562925</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>447</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">447</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hori, S.

It is not yet clear how early a clinical blood assay can be used to detect cancer or how biomarker-based strategies can be improved to enable earlier detection of smaller tumors. To address these issues, we developed a mathematical model describing dynamic plasma biomarker kinetics in relation to the growth of a tumor, beginning with a single cancer cell. To exemplify a realistic scenario in which biomarker is shed by both cancerous and noncancerous cells, we primed the model on ovarian tumor growth and CA125 shedding data, for which tumor growth parameters and shedding rates are readily available in published literature. We found that a tumor could grow unnoticed for more than 10.1 years and reach a volume of about π/6(25.36 mm)(3), corresponding to a spherical diameter of about 25.36 mm, before becoming detectable by current clinical blood assays. Model parameters were perturbed over log orders of magnitude to quantify ideal shedding rates and identify other blood-based strategies required for early submillimeter tumor detectability. The detection times we estimated are consistent with recently published tumor progression time lines based on clinical genomic sequencing data for several cancers. Here, we rigorously showed that shedding rates of current clinical blood biomarkers are likely 10(4)-fold too low to enable detection of a developing tumor within the first decade of tumor growth. The model presented here can be extended to virtually any solid cancer and associated biomarkers.</abstract><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22089452</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>3/109/109ra116 [pii]; &#xD;10.1126/scitranslmed.3003110</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1308</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1308</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoopes, P.

The accuracy and usefulness of this information varies with the type of thermal treatment, sensitivity and accuracy of tissue assessment, and volume, shape, and heterogeneity of the tumor target and normal tissue. That said, without the development of an algorithm that has allowed the comparison and prediction of the effects of hyperthermia in a wide variety of tumor and normal tissues and settings (cumulative equivalent minutes/ CEM), hyperthermia would never have achieved clinical relevance. A new hyperthermia technology, magnetic nanoparticle-based hyperthermia (mNPH), has distinct advantages over the previous techniques: the ability to target the heat to individual cancer cells (with a nontoxic nanoparticle), and to excite the nanoparticles noninvasively with a noninjurious magnetic field, thus sparing associated normal cells and greatly improving the therapeutic ratio. As such, this modality has great potential as a primary and adjuvant cancer therapy. Although the targeted and safe nature of the noninvasive external activation (hysteretic heating) are a tremendous asset, the large number of therapy based variables and the lack of an accurate and useful method for predicting, assessing and quantifying mNP dose and treatment effect is a major obstacle to moving the technology into routine clinical practice. Among other parameters, mNPH will require the accurate determination of specific nanoparticle heating capability, the total nanoparticle content and biodistribution in the target cells/tissue, and an effective and matching alternating magnetic field (AMF) for optimal and safe excitation of the nanoparticles. Our initial studies have shown that appropriately delivered and targeted nanoparticles are capable of achieving effective tumor cytotoxicity at measured thermal doses significantly less than the understood thermal dose values necessary to achieve equivalent treatment effects using conventional heat delivery techniques. Therefore conventional CEM based thermal dose - tissues effect relationships will not hold for mNPH. The goal of this effort is to provide a platform for determining the biological and physical parameters that will be necessary for accurately planning and performing safe and effective mNPH, creating a new, viable primary or adjuvant cancer therapy.</abstract><notes>10.1117/12.877026</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.877026</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.877026</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1276</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1276</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hood, L.</author><author>Friend, S.

P4 medicine will be fueled by systems approaches to disease, emerging technologies and analytical tools. There will be two major challenges to achieving P4 medicine--technical and societal barriers--and the societal barriers will prove the most challenging. How do we bring patients, physicians and members of the health-care community into alignment with the enormous opportunities of P4 medicine? In part, this will be done by the creation of new types of strategic partnerships--between patients, large clinical centers, consortia of clinical centers and patient-advocate groups.

Glands are supported by stroma, which is activated in the proximity of a tumor. Activated stroma is often characterized by the molecular expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) within fibroblasts. However, the precise spatial and temporal evolution of chemical changes in fibroblasts upon epithelial tumor signaling is poorly understood. Here we report a label-free method to characterize fibroblast changes by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging and comparing spectra with alpha-SMA expression in primary normal human fibroblasts. We recorded the fibroblast activation process by spectroscopic imaging using increasingly tissue-like conditions: 1), stimulation with the growth factor TGFbeta1; 2), coculture with MCF-7 human breast cancerous epithelial cells in Transwell coculture; and 3), coculture with MCF-7 in three-dimensional cell culture. Finally, we compared the spectral signatures of stromal transformation with normal and malignant human breast tissue biopsies. The results indicate that this approach reveals temporally complex spectral changes and thus provides a richer assessment than simple molecular imaging based on alpha-SMA expression.

Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) are attractive candidates for molecular biosensing applications because most biological samples exhibit negligible magnetic susceptibility, and thus the background against which measurements are made is extremely low. Numerous magnetic detection methods exist, but sensing based on magnetic resonance effects has successfully been developed into a general detection platform termed diagnostic magnetic resonance (DMR). DMR technology encompasses numerous assay configurations and sensing principles, and to date magnetic nanoparticle biosensors have been designed to detect a wide range of targets including DNA/mRNA, proteins, enzymes, drugs, pathogens, and tumor cells with exquisite sensitivity. The core principle behind DMR is the use of MNP as proximity sensors that modulate the transverse relaxation time of neighboring water molecules. This signal can be quantified using MR imagers or NMR relaxometers, including miniaturized NMR detector chips that are capable of performing highly sensitive measurements on microliter sample volumes and in a multiplexed format. The speed, sensitivity, and simplicity of the DMR principle, coupled with further advances in NMR biosensor technology should provide a high-throughput, low-cost, and portable platform for large-scale parallel sensing in clinical and point-of-care settings.</abstract><notes>Haun, Jered B; Yoon, Tae-Jong; Lee, Hakho; Weissleder, Ralph; Clifton, N.J.; Methods Mol Biol. 2011;726:33-49.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21424441</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-1-61779-052-2_3</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>730</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">730</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haun, J.

Here, we report the development of a quantitative micro-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) system for rapid, multiplexed analysis of human tumors. We implemented the technology in a clinical setting to analyze cells obtained by fine-needle aspirates from suspected lesions in 50 patients and validated the results in an independent cohort of another 20 patients. Single fine-needle aspirates yielded sufficient numbers of cells to enable quantification of multiple protein markers in all patients within 60 min. Moreover, using a four-protein signature, we report a 96% accuracy for establishing a cancer diagnosis, surpassing conventional clinical analyses by immunohistochemistry. Our results also show that protein expression patterns decay with time, underscoring the need for rapid sampling and diagnosis close to the patient bedside. We also observed a surprising degree of heterogeneity in protein expression both across the different patient samples and even within the same tumor, which has important implications for molecular diagnostics and therapeutic drug targeting. Our quantitative point-of-care micro-NMR technique shows potential for cancer diagnosis in the clinic.</abstract><notes>Haun, Jered B; Castro, Cesar M; Wang, Rui; Peterson, Vanessa M; Marinelli, Brett S; Lee, Hakho; Weissleder, Ralph; F32 CA144139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; F32 CA144139-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA127003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA127003-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626-07/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB010011/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB010011-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; T32 CA079443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA079443-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 HL080731-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119349-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; UO1 HL080731/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; Sci Transl Med. 2011 Feb 23;3(71):71ra16.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21346169</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3086073</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/scitranslmed.3002048</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>55</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">55</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hao, L.</author><author>Patel, P.

RESULTS: The chitosan hydrogel (CH-HG) displayed a liquid-solid phase transition in a temperature-dependent manner and formed an endothermic hydrogel in tumor tissue after intra-tumoral injection. Additionally, we tested the extent of in vivo delivery following a single intra-tumoral injection of Alexa555 siRNA/CH-HG into A375SM-bearing mice. The Alexa555 siRNA demonstrated higher localization into tumor cells compared to control. The Alexa555 siRNA delivery extends to tumor cells outside of CH-HG and some tumor cells also infiltrated into CH-HG. For therapeutic proof-of-concept studies, CH-HG including TG2-targeted siRNA significantly inhibited tumor growth in melanoma (A375SM) and breast (MDA-MB231) tumor models compared to control (A375SM: 72% reduction and MDA-MB231: 92% reduction, p &lt; 0.001). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: we prepared a CH-HG system loaded with siRNA to enhance localized therapeutic efficacy without risk for systemic side effects. Delivery of siRNA into CH-HG was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Antitumor efficacy was examined in mouse models of melanoma (A375SM) and breast (MDA-MD231) cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a novel local delivery method for siRNA therapy using the CH-HG system. This approach could have broad applications for multiple localized diseases.</abstract><notes>Han, Hee Dong; Mora, Edna M; Roh, Ju Won; Nishimura, Masato; Lee, Sun Joo; Stone, Rebecca L; Bar-Eli, Menashe; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K; BC085265/BC/NCI NIH HHS/; CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; HD050128/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/; OC-073399/OC/ONCHIT HHS/; P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2 GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Biol Ther. 2011 May 1;11(9):839-45.

Light is used to probe cellular and molecular function in the context of cancer in the living body. Recent advances in the development of optical instrumentation make it possible to detect optical signals produced at a tissue depth of several centimeters. The optical signals can be endogenous contrasts that capture the heterogeneity and biological status of different tissues, including tumors, or extrinsic optical contrasts that selectively accumulate in tumors to be imaged after local or systemic delivery. The use of optical imaging is now being applied in the clinic and operating room for the localization and resection of malignant tumors in addition to screening for cancer.</abstract><notes>Hadjipanayis, Costas G; Jiang, Huabei; Roberts, David W; Yang, Lily; K08 NS053454/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; K08 NS053454-01A1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; K08 NS053454-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; K08 NS053454-03/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; K08 NS053454-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; K08 NS053454-05/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; K25CA138578/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA133722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA133722-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01NS052274-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; U54 CA119338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Semin Oncol. 2011 Feb;38(1):109-18.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21362519</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3061227</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1053/j.seminoncol.2010.11.008</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>330</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">330</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gurard-Levin, Z.

The development of &quot;label-free&quot; assays addresses many of these limitations, but current approaches still lack the throughput needed for applications in drug discovery. This paper describes a high-throughput, label-free assay that combines self-assembled monolayers with mass spectrometry, in a technique called SAMDI, as a tool for screening libraries of 100,000 compounds in one day. This method is fast, has high discrimination, and is amenable to a broad range of chemical and biological applications.</abstract><notes>Gurard-Levin, Zachary A; Scholle, Michael D; Eisenberg, Adam H; Mrksich, Milan; P50 GM086145/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM084188/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U54 CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; ACS Comb Sci. 2011 Jul 11;13(4):347-50.

Targeting such alterations, therefore, may lead to cancer prevention. By crossing our previously established phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten)-null acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) model onto the recombination-activating gene 1(-/-) background, we show that the lack of variable, diversity and joining [V(D)J] recombination completely abolishes the Tcralpha/delta-c-myc translocation and T-ALL development, regardless of beta-catenin activation. We identify mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a regulator of beta-selection. Rapamycin, an mTOR-specific inhibitor, alters nutrient sensing and blocks T-cell differentiation from CD4(-)CD8(-) to CD4(+)CD8(+), the stage where the Tcralpha/delta-c-myc translocation occurs. Long-term rapamycin treatment of preleukemic Pten-null mice prevents Tcralpha/delta-c-myc translocation and leukemia stem cell (LSC) formation, and it halts T-ALL development. However, rapamycin alone fails to inhibit mTOR signaling in the c-Kit(mid)CD3(+)Lin(-) population enriched for LSCs and eliminate these cells. Our results support the idea that preventing LSC formation and selectively targeting LSCs are promising approaches for antileukemia therapies.</abstract><notes>Guo, Wei; Schubbert, Suzanne; Chen, James Y; Valamehr, Bahram; Mosessian, Sherly; Shi, Hubing; Dang, Nhi H; Garcia, Consuelo; Theodoro, Mariana F; Varella-Garcia, Marileila; Wu, Hong; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jan 25;108(4):1409-14.

Three novel 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-conjugated GnRH peptides were designed and synthesized. The radiometal chelator DOTA was conjugated to the epsilon or alpha amino group of D-lysine, or the epsilon amino group of L-lysine via an Ahx {aminohexanoic acid} linker to generate DOTA-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH1), DOTA-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH2) and DOTA-Ahx-(L-Lys(6)-GnRH3), respectively. The conjugation of the DOTA to the epsilon amino group of D-lysine (rather than alpha amino group of D-lysine nor epsilon amino group of L-lysine) maintained the nanomolar GnRH receptor binding affinity. The IC(50) values of DOTA-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH1), DOTA-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH2) and DOTA-Ahx-(L-Lys(6)-GnRH3) were 36.1 nM, 10.6 mM and 4.3 mM, respectively. Since only DOTA-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH1) displayed nanomolar receptor binding affinity, the specific GnRH receptor binding of (111)In-DOTA-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH1) was determined in human GnRH receptor membrane preparations. Furthermore, the biodistribution and tumor imaging properties of (111)In-DOTA-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH1) were examined in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer-xenografted nude mice. (111)In-DOTA-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH1) exhibited specific GnRH receptor binding and rapid tumor uptake (1.76 +/- 0.58% ID/g at 0.5 h postinjection) coupled with fast whole-body clearance through the urinary system. The MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer-xenografted tumor lesions were clearly visualized by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT at 1 h postinjection of (111)In-DOTA-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH1). The profound impact of DOTA position on the binding affinity of the GnRH peptide provided a new insight into the design of novel radiolabeled GnRH peptides. The successful imaging of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer-xenografted tumor lesions using (111)In-DOTA-Ahx-(D-Lys(6)-GnRH1) suggested its potential as a novel imaging probe for human breast cancer imaging.</abstract><notes>Guo, Haixun; Lu, Jie; Hathaway, Helen; Royce, Melanie E; Prossnitz, Eric R; Miao, Yubin; P20 RR016480-12/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; P20RR016480/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; P30 CA118100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Bioconjug Chem. 2011 Aug 17;22(8):1682-9.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (EGFRvIII) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) hyperactivation are common in GBM, promoting tumor growth and survival, including through sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1)-dependent lipogenesis. The role of cholesterol metabolism in GBM pathogenesis, its association with EGFR/PI3K signaling, and its potential therapeutic targetability are unknown. In our investigation, studies of GBM cell lines, xenograft models, and GBM clinical samples, including those from patients treated with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib, uncovered an EGFRvIII-activated, PI3K/SREBP-1-dependent tumor survival pathway through the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Targeting LDLR with the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist GW3965 caused inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL)-mediated LDLR degradation and increased expression of the ABCA1 cholesterol efflux transporter, potently promoting tumor cell death in an in vivo GBM model. These results show that EGFRvIII can promote tumor survival through PI3K/SREBP-1-dependent upregulation of LDLR and suggest a role for LXR agonists in the treatment of GBM patients.</abstract><notes>R01 NS073831-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R21 NS072838-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R21 NS072838-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; U54 CA119347-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Discov. 2011 Oct;1(5):442-456.

Here, we report the in vivo administration of siRNA to Parp1 in mouse models of ovarian cancer. A unique member of the lipid-like materials known as lipidoids is shown to deliver siRNA to disseminated murine ovarian carcinoma allograft tumors following intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. siParp1 inhibits cell growth, primarily by induction of apoptosis, in Brca1-deficient cells both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the treatment extends the survival of mice bearing tumors derived from Brca1-deficient ovarian cancer cells but not from Brca1 wild-type cells, confirming the proposed mechanism of synthetic lethality. Because there are 17 members of the Parp family, the inherent complementarity of RNA affords a high level of specificity for therapeutically addressing Parp1 in the context of impaired homologous recombination.</abstract><notes>Goldberg, Michael S; Xing, Deyin; Ren, Yin; Orsulic, Sandra; Bhatia, Sangeeta N; Sharp, Phillip A; P30-CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jan 11;108(2):745-50.

Nanoparticles currently used in the clinic, and the majority of nanotherapeutics/nanodiagnostics under investigation, accommodate single- or multiple- functionalities on the same entity. Because many heterogeneous biological barriers can prevent therapeutic and imaging agents from reaching their intended targets in sufficient concentrations, there is an emerging requirement to develop a multimodular nanoassembly, in which different components with individual specific functions act in a synergistic manner. The multistage nanovectors (MSVs) were introduced in 2008 as the first system of this type. It comprises several nanocomponents or &quot;stages&quot;, each of which is designed to negotiate one or more biological barriers. Stage 1 mesoporous silicon particles (S1MPs) were rationally designed and fabricated in a nonspherical geometry to enable superior blood margination and to increase cell surface adhesion. The main task of S1MPs is to efficiently transport nanoparticles that are loaded into their porous structure and to protect them during transport from the administration site to the disease lesion. Semiconductor fabrication techniques including photolithography and electrochemical etching allow for the exquisite control and precise reproducibility of S1MP physical characteristics such as geometry and porosity. Furthermore, S1MPs can be chemically modified with negatively/positively charged groups, PEG and other polymers, fluorescent probes, contrast agents, and biologically active targeting moieties including antibodies, peptides, aptamers, and phage. The payload nanoparticles, termed stage 2 nanoparticles (S2NPs), can be any currently available nanoparticles such as liposomes, micelles, inorganic/metallic nanoparticles, dendrimers, and carbon structures, within the approximate size range of 5-100 nm in diameter. Depending upon the physicochemical features of the S1MP (geometry, porosity, and surface modifications), a variety of S2NPs or nanoparticle &quot;cocktails&quot; can be loaded and efficiently delivered to the disease site. As demonstrated in the studies reviewed here, once the S2NPs are loaded into the S1MPs, a variety of novel properties emerge, which enable the design of new and improved imaging contrast agents and therapeutics. For example, the loading of the MRI Gd-based contrast agents onto hemispherical and discoidal S1MPs significantly increased the longitudal relaxivity (r1) to values of up to 50 times larger than those of clinically available gadolinium-based agents (~4 mM(-1) s(-1)/Gd(3+) ion). Furthermore, administration of a single dose of MSVs loaded with neutral nanoliposomes containing small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted against the EphA2 oncoprotein enabled sustained EphA2 gene silencing for at least 21 days. As a result, the tumor burden was reduced in an orthotopic mouse model of ovarian cancer. We envision that the versatility of the MSV platform and its emerging properties will enable the creation of personalized solutions with broad clinical implications within and beyond the realm of cancer theranostics.</abstract><notes>Godin, Biana; Tasciotti, Ennio; Liu, Xuewu; Serda, Rita E; Ferrari, Mauro; 1U54CA151668-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Acc Chem Res. 2011 Oct 18;44(10):979-89.

Its utility as a clinical modality has been limited by a minimally selective tumor sensitivity and the inability to be delivered in a tumor-specific manner. Recent in vivo studies (rodent and human) have shown that cancer cell-specific cytotoxicity can be effectively and safely delivered via iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (mNP) and an appropriately matched noninvasive alternating magnetic field (AMF). To explore the tumor radiosensitization potential of mNP hyperthermia we used a syngeneic mouse breast cancer model, dextran-coated 110 nm hydrodynamic diameter mNP and a 169 kHz / 450 Oe (35.8 kA/m) AMF. Intradermally implanted (flank) tumors (150 ± 40 mm3) were treated by injection of 0.04 ml mNP (7.5 mg Fe) / cm3 into the tumor and an AMF (35.8 kA/m and 169 kHz) exposure necessary to achieve a CEM (cumulative equivalent minute) thermal dose of 60 (CEM 60). Tumors were treated with mNP hyperthermia (CEM 60), radiation alone (15 Gy, single dose) and in combination. Compared to the radiation and heat alone treatments, the combined treatment resulted in a greater than two-fold increase in tumor regrowth tripling time (tumor treatment efficacy). None of the treatments resulted in significant normal tissue toxicity or morbidity. Studies were also conducted to compare the radiosensitization effect of mNP hyperthermia with that of microwave-induced hyperthermia. The effects of incubation of nanoparticles within tumors (to allow nanoparticles to be endocytosed) before application of AMF and radiation were determined. This preliminary information suggests cancer cell specific hyperthermia (i.e. antibody-directed or anatomically-directed mNP) is capable of providing significantly greater radiosensitization / therapeutic ratio enhancement than other forms of hyperthermia delivery.</abstract><notes>10.1117/12.876515</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.876515</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.876515</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>509</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">509</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giustini, A.

To determine the mechanism of nanoparticle-induced cytotoxicity, the physical association of the cancer cells and the nanoparticles must be determined. We have used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to define the time dependent cellular uptake of intratumorally administered dextran-coated, core-shell configuration IONP having a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 100-130 nm in a murine breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MTG-B) in vivo. Tumors averaging volumes of 115 mm3 were injected with iron oxide nanoparticles. The tumors were then excised and fixed for TEM at time 0.1-120 h post-IONP injection. Intracellular uptake of IONPs was 5.0, 48.8 and 91.1% uptake at one, 2 and 4 h post-injection of IONPs, respectively.

This treatment is effective as a monotherapy as well as a therapeutic adjuvant to chemotherapy and radiation. Iron oxide nanoparticles have been shown, so far, to be non-toxic, as are the exciting AMF fields when used at moderate levels. Although higher levels of AMF can be more effective, depending on the type of iron oxide nanoparticles use, these higher field strengths and/or frequencies can induce normal tissue heating and toxicity. Thus, the use of nanoparticles exhibiting significant heating at low AMF strengths and frequencies is desirable. Our preliminary experiments have shown that the aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles within tumor cells improves their heating effect and cytotoxicity per nanoparticle. We have used transmission electron microscopy to track the endocytosis of nanoparticles into tumor cells (both breast adenocarcinoma (MTG-B) and acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells). Our preliminary results suggest that nanoparticles internalized into tumor cells demonstrate greater cytotoxicity when excited with AMF than an equivalent heat dose from excited external nanoparticles or cells exposed to a hot water bath. We have also demonstrated that this increase in SAR caused by aggregation improves the cytotoxicity of nanoparticle hyperthermia therapy in vitro.</abstract><notes>10.1117/12.876519</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.876519</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.876519</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>967</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">967</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Girodon, F. </author><author>Steinkamp, M.

Sensitive and specific imaging of pancreas cancer are necessary for accurate diagnosis, staging, and treatment. The vast majority of pancreas cancers express the carbohydrate tumor antigen CA19-9. The goal of this study was to determine the potential to target CA19-9 with a radiolabeled anti-CA19-9 antibody for imaging pancreas cancer. Methods. CA19-9 was quantified using flow cytometry on human pancreas cancer cell lines. An intact murine anti-CA19-9 monoclonal antibody was labeled with a positron emitting radionuclide (Iodine-124) and injected into mice harboring antigen positive and negative xenografts. MicroPET/CT were performed at successive time intervals (72 hours, 96 hours, 120 hours) after injection. Radioactivity was measured in blood and tumor to provide objective confirmation of the images. Results. Antigen expression by flow cytometry revealed approximately 1.3 x 10(6) CA19-9 antigens for the positive cell line and no expression in the negative cell line. Pancreas xenograft imaging with Iodine-124-labeled anti-CA19-9 mAb demonstrated an average tumor to blood ratio of 5 and positive to negative tumor ratio of 20. Conclusion. We show in vivo targeting of our antigen positive xenograft with a radiolabeled anti-CA19-9 antibody. These data demonstrate the potential to achieve anti-CA19-9 antibody based positron emission tomography of pancreas cancer.</abstract><notes>Girgis, Mark D; Olafsen, Tove; Kenanova, Vania; McCabe, Katelyn E; Wu, Anna M; Tomlinson, James S; Egypt; International journal of molecular imaging; Int J Mol Imaging. 2011;2011:834515.

Smaller engineered antibody fragments overcome this problem by exhibiting shorter serum half-lives (4-20 h).The diabody (55 kDa) is the smallest antibody fragment, which retains the bivalency of the intact antibody. Our goal was to develop and characterize the anti-CA19-9 diabody fragment and determine its ability to provide antigen specific imaging of pancreas cancer. METHODS: The diabody DNA construct was created by isolation of the variable region genes of the intact anti-CA19-9 antibody. Diabody expression was carried out in NS0 cells and purified using HPLC from supernatant. Specific antigen binding was confirmed with flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Radiolabeled diabody was injected into mice harboring an antigen positive xenograft (BxPC3 or Capan-2) and a negative xenograft (MiaPaca-2). MicroCT and MicroPET were performed at successive time intervals after injection. Radioactivity was measured in blood and tumor to provide objective confirmation of the microPET images. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry showed specific binding of the anti-CA19-9 diabody. Pancreas xenograft imaging of BxPC3/MiaPaca-2 and Capan-2/MiaPaca-2 models with the anti-CA19-9 diabody demonstrated an average tumor:blood ratio of 5.0 and 2.0, respectively, and an average positive:negative tumor ratio of 11 and 6, respectively. With respect to the tumor:blood ratio, these data indicate five times and two times more radioactivity in the tumor than in the blood yielding adequate contrast between tumor tissue and background (i.e., blood) to create the representative microPET images. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully engineered a functional diabody against CA19-9, a tumor antigen present on the vast majority of pancreas cancers. Additionally, we demonstrate high contrast antigen specific microPET imaging of pancreas cancer in xenograft models.</abstract><notes>Girgis, Mark D; Kenanova, Vania; Olafsen, Tove; McCabe, Katelyn E; Wu, Anna M; Tomlinson, James S; AI-28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; CA-16042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; United States; The Journal of surgical research; J Surg Res. 2011 Oct;170(2):169-78.

Chemoresistance in various malignancies has been attributed to cancer stem cells (CSCs). We sought to identify gastrointestinal neuroendocrine CSCs (N-CSCs) in surgical specimens and a NET cell line and to characterize novel N-CSC therapeutic targets. METHODS: Human gastrointestinal NETs were evaluated for CSCs using the Aldefluor (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) assay. An in vitro, sphere-forming assay was performed on primary NET cells. CNDT2.5, a human midgut carcinoid cell line, was used for in vitro (sphere-formation) and in vivo (tumorigenicity assays) CSC studies. N-CSC protein expression was characterized using Western blotting. In vivo, systemic short interfering RNA administration targeted Src. RESULTS: By using the Aldefluor assay, aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive (ALDH+) cells comprised 5.8% +/- 1.4% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) of cells from 19 patient samples. Although many primary cell lines failed to grow, CNDT96 ALDH+ cells formed spheres in anchorage-independent conditions, whereas ALDH- cells did not. CNDT2.5 ALDH+ cells formed spheres, whereas ALDH- cells did not. In vivo, ALDH+ CNDT2.5 cells generated more tumors, with shorter latency than ALDH- or sham-sorted cells. Compared with non-CSCs, ALDH+ cells demonstrated increased expression of activated Src, Erk, Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In vivo, anti-Src short interfering RNA treatment of ALDH+ tumors reduced tumor mass by 91%. CONCLUSIONS: CSCs are present in NETs, as shown by in vitro sphere formation and in vivo tumorigenicity assays. Src was activated in N-CSCs and represents a potential therapeutic target in gastrointestinal NETs.</abstract><notes>Gaur, Puja; Sceusi, Eric L; Samuel, Shaija; Xia, Ling; Fan, Fan; Zhou, Yunfei; Lu, Jia; Tozzi, Federico; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Vivas-Mejia, Pablo; Rashid, Asif; Fleming, Jason B; Abdalla, Eddie K; Curley, Steven A; Vauthey, Jean-Nicolas; Sood, Anil K; Yao, James C; Ellis, Lee M; CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA009599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Gastroenterology. 2011 Nov;141(5):1728-37.

Label-free kinetic assays based on surface plasmon resonance are the current gold standard, but they have poor detection limits, suffer from non-specific binding, and are not amenable to high-throughput analyses. Here, we show that magnetically responsive nanosensors that have been scaled to over 100,000 sensors per cm(2) can be used to measure the binding kinetics of various proteins with high spatial and temporal resolution. We present an analytical model that describes the binding of magnetically labelled antibodies to proteins that are immobilized on the sensor surface. This model is able to quantify the kinetics of antibody-antigen binding at sensitivities as low as 20 zeptomoles of solute.</abstract><notes>Gaster, Richard S; Xu, Liang; Han, Shu-Jen; Wilson, Robert J; Hall, Drew A; Osterfeld, Sebastian J; Yu, Heng; Wang, Shan X; 1U54CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; 1U54CA143907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; 1U54CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; U54 CA119367-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; U54 CA151459-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.; England; Nature nanotechnology; Nat Nanotechnol. 2011 May;6(5):314-20.

The future of basic diagnostic medicine will lie in the hands of private individuals. We have taken significant strides towards achieving this goal by developing an autoassembly assay for disease biomarker detection which obviates the need for washing steps and is run on a handheld sensing platform. By coupling magnetic nanotechnology with an array of magnetically responsive nanosensors, we demonstrate a rapid, multiplex immunoassay that eliminates the need for trained technicians to run molecular diagnostic tests. Furthermore, the platform is battery-powered and ultraportable, allowing the assay to be run anywhere in the world by any individual.</abstract><notes>Gaster, Richard S; Hall, Drew A; Wang, Shan X; 1U54CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.; England; Lab on a chip; Lab Chip. 2011 Mar 7;11(5):950-6.

However, to date, such materials have almost exclusively been investigated as homogeneous self-assemblies, having functional components uniformly distributed throughout their supramolecular structures. Here we illustrate control over the intermixing of multiple different self-assembling peptides, in turn providing a simple but powerful means for modulating these materials&apos; mechanical and biological properties. In beta-sheet fibrillizing hydrogels, significant increases in stiffening could be achieved using heterobifunctional cross-linkers by sequestering peptides bearing different reactive groups into distinct populations of fibrils, thus favoring interfibril cross-linking. Further, by specifying the intermixing of RGD-bearing peptides in 2-D and 3-D self-assemblies, the growth of HUVECs and NIH 3T3 cells could be significantly modulated. This approach may be immediately applicable toward a wide variety of self-assembling systems that form stable supramolecular structures.</abstract><notes>Gasiorowski, Joshua Z&#xD;Collier, Joel H&#xD;1R01EB009701/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB009701/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB009701-01/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB009701-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB009701-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB009701-04/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151880-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Biomacromolecules. 2011 Oct 10;12(10):3549-58. doi: 10.1021/bm200763y.

Optical characterization of the nanocone substrate showed it can support several plasmonic modes (in the 300-800 nm wavelength range) that can be coupled to a fluorophore on the surface of the substrate, which gives rise to the enhanced fluorescence. Spectral analysis suggests that a nanocone substrate can create more excitons and shorter lifetime in the model fluorophore Rhodamine 6G (R6G) due to plasmon resonance energy transfer from the nanocone substrate to the nearby fluorophore. We observed three-dimensional fluorescence enhancement on our substrate shown from the confocal fluorescence imaging of chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells grown on the substrate. The fluorescence intensity from the fluorophores bound on the cell membrane was amplified more than 100-fold as compared to that on a glass substrate. We believe that strong scattering within the nanostructured area coupled with random scattering inside the cell resulted in the observed three-dimensional enhancement in fluorescence with higher photostability on the substrate surface.</abstract><notes>Gartia, Manas Ranjan&#xD;Hsiao, Austin&#xD;Sivaguru, Mayandi&#xD;Chen, Yi&#xD;Liu, G Logan&#xD;England&#xD;Nanotechnology. 2011 Sep 7;22(36):365203.

FUS-positive neuropathology is reported in a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS and fronto-temporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive pathology (FTLDU). To examine protein aggregation and cytotoxicity, we expressed human FUS protein in yeast. Expression of either wild type or ALS-associated R524S or P525L mutant FUS in yeast cells led to formation of aggregates and cytotoxicity, with the two ALS mutants showing increased cytotoxicity. Therefore, yeast cells expressing human FUS protein recapitulate key features of FUS-positive neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, a significant fraction of FUS expressing yeast cells stained by propidium iodide were without detectable protein aggregates, suggesting that membrane impairment and cellular damage caused by FUS expression may occur before protein aggregates become microscopically detectable and that aggregate formation might protect cells from FUS-mediated cytotoxicity. The N-terminus of FUS, containing the QGSY and G rich regions, is sufficient for the formation of aggregates but not cytotoxicity. The C-terminal domain, which contains a cluster of mutations, did not show aggregation or cytotoxicity. Similar to TDP-43 when expressed in yeast, FUS protein has the intrinsic property of forming aggregates in the absence of other human proteins. On the other hand, the aggregates formed by FUS are thioflavin T-positive and resistant to 0.5% sarkosyl, unlike TDP-43 when expressed in yeast cells. Furthermore, TDP-43 and FUS display distinct domain requirements in aggregate formation and cytotoxicity.</abstract><notes>Fushimi, Kazuo; Long, Charles; Jayaram, Neha; Chen, Xiaoping; Li, Liming; Wu, Jane Y; R01 NS056086-05/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01NS056086/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; U54 CA151880-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Germany; Protein Cell. 2011 Feb;2(2):141-9.

The three conjugates showed ten-fold higher solubility in the liquid oil phase Miglyol 808 than DX. To further increase the drug entrapment efficiency in NPs, orthogonal design was performed. The optimized formulation was composed of Miglyol 808, Brij 78, and Vitamin E tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS). The conjugates were successfully entrapped in the reduced-surfactant NPs with entrapment efficiencies of about 50%-60% as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. All three conjugates showed 45% initial burst release in 100% mouse plasma. Whereas C12-DX showed another 40% release over the next 8 hours, C18-DX and C22-DX in NPs showed no additional release after the initial burst of drug. All conjugates showed significantly lower cytotoxicity than DX in human DU-145 prostate cancer cells. The half maximal inhibitory concentration values (IC(50)) of free conjugates and conjugate NPs were comparable except for C22-DX, which was nontoxic in the tested concentration range and showed only vehicle toxicity when entrapped in NPs. In vivo, the total area under the curve (AUC(0-infinity)) values of all DX conjugate NPs were significantly greater than that of Taxotere, demonstrating prolonged retention of drug in the blood. The AUC(0-infinity) value of DX in Taxotere was 8.3-fold, 358.0-fold, and 454.5-fold lower than that of NP-formulated C12-DX, C18-DX, and C22-DX, respectively. The results of these studies strongly support the idea that the physical/chemical properties of DX conjugates may be fine-tuned to influence the affinity and retention of DX in oil-filled lipid NPs, which leads to very different pharmacokinetic profiles and blood exposure of an otherwise potent chemo-therapeutic agent. These studies and methodologies may allow for improved and more potent nanoparticle-based formulations.</abstract><notes>Feng, Lan; Wu, Huali; Ma, Ping; Mumper, Russell J; Benhabbour, S Rahima; New Zealand; Int J Nanomedicine. 2011;6:2545-56.

Here we interrogated how a protein&apos;s stability, cellular localization, and abundance affect its observability in blood by mass-spectrometry-based proteomics techniques. We performed proteomic profiling on tumors and plasma from two different xenograft mouse models. A statistical analysis of this data revealed protein properties indicative of the detection level in plasma. Though 20% of the proteins identified in plasma were tumor-derived, only 5% of the proteins observed in the tumor tissue were found in plasma. Both intracellular and extracellular tumor proteins were observed in plasma; however, after normalizing for tumor abundance, extracellular proteins were seven times more likely to be detected. Although proteins that were more abundant in the tumor were also more likely to be observed in plasma, the relationship was nonlinear: Doubling the spectral count increased detection rate by only 50%. Many secreted proteins, even those with relatively low spectral count, were observed in plasma, but few low abundance intracellular proteins were observed. Proteins predicted to be stable by dipeptide composition were significantly more likely to be identified in plasma than less stable proteins. The number of tryptic peptides in a protein was not significantly related to the chance of a protein being observed in plasma. Quantitative comparison of large versus small tumors revealed that the abundance of proteins in plasma as measured by spectral count was associated with the tumor size, but the relationship was not one-to-one; a 3-fold decrease in tumor size resulted in a 16-fold decrease in protein abundance in plasma. This study provides quantitative support for a tumor-derived marker prioritization strategy that favors secreted and stable proteins over all but the most abundant intracellular proteins.</abstract><notes>Fang, Qiaojun; Kani, Kian; Faca, Vitor M; Zhang, Wenxuan; Zhang, Qing; Jain, Anjali; Hanash, Sam; Agus, David B; McIntosh, Martin W; Mallick, Parag; U54 CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; United States; PloS one; PLoS One. 2011;6(7):e23090.

We developed a microfluidic device capable of separating and amplifying homologous copies of each chromosome from a single human metaphase cell. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis of amplified DNA enabled us to achieve completely deterministic, whole-genome, personal haplotypes of four individuals, including a HapMap trio with European ancestry (CEU) and an unrelated European individual. The phases of alleles were determined at approximately 99.8% accuracy for up to approximately 96% of all assayed SNPs. We demonstrate several practical applications, including direct observation of recombination events in a family trio, deterministic phasing of deletions in individuals and direct measurement of the human leukocyte antigen haplotypes of an individual. Our approach has potential applications in personal genomics, single-cell genomics and statistical genetics.</abstract><notes>Fan, H Christina; Wang, Jianbin; Potanina, Anastasia; Quake, Stephen R; U54/PHS HHS/United States; Evaluation Studies; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; United States; Nature biotechnology; Nat Biotechnol. 2011 Jan;29(1):51-7.

Current methods for assaying cellular intermolecular interactions are mainly used for cells in culture and have limited use for the noninvasive assessment of small animal disease models. Here, we describe red light-emitting reporter systems based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) that allow for assaying PPIs both in cell culture and deep tissues of small animals. These BRET systems consist of the recently developed Renilla reniformis luciferase (RLuc) variants RLuc8 and RLuc8.6, used as BRET donors, combined with two red fluorescent proteins, TagRFP and TurboFP635, as BRET acceptors. In addition to the native coelenterazine luciferase substrate, we used the synthetic derivative coelenterazine-v, which further red-shifts the emission maxima of Renilla luciferases by 35 nm. We show the use of these BRET systems for ratiometric imaging of both cells in culture and deep-tissue small animal tumor models and validate their applicability for studying PPIs in mice in the context of rapamycin-induced FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12)-FKBP12 rapamycin binding domain (FRB) association. These red light-emitting BRET systems have great potential for investigating PPIs in the context of drug screening and target validation applications.</abstract><notes>Dragulescu-Andrasi, Anca; Chan, Carmel T; De, Abhijit; Massoud, Tarik F; Gambhir, Sanjiv S; P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA082214/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jul 19;108(29):12060-5.

We find that expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) increases in the neonatal mouse brain after unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxia. Since signaling by the BMP family of factors is a potent inhibitor of oligodendroglial differentiation, we tested the hypothesis that antagonism of BMP signaling would prevent loss of oligodendroglia (OL) and white matter in a mouse model of perinatal HI. Perinatal HI was induced in transgenic mice in which the BMP antagonist noggin is overexpressed during oligodendrogenesis (pNSE-Noggin). Following perinatal HI, pNSE-Noggin mice had more oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) and more mature OL compared to wild type (WT) animals. The increase in OPC numbers did not result from proliferation but rather from increased differentiation from precursor cells. Immunofluorescence studies showed preservation of white matter in lesioned pNSE-Noggin mice compared to lesioned WT animals. Further, following perinatal HI, the pNSE-Noggin mice were protected from gait deficits. Together these findings indicate that the BMP-inhibitor noggin protects from HI-induced loss of oligodendroglial lineage cells and white matter as well as loss of motor function.</abstract><notes>Journal article; Neurobiology of disease; Neurobiol Dis. 2011 Feb 17.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310236</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>PMC3079774</custom2><electronic-resource-num>S0969-9961(11)00044-1 [pii]; 10.1016/j.nbd.2011.01.023</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>976</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">976</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ding, X.</author><author>Singh, R.</author><author>Burke, A.</author><author>Hatcher, H.</author><author>Olson, J.</author><author>Kraft, R.

MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: MWCNTs entrapping iron were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition. The T2-weighted contrast enhancement properties of MWCNTs containing increasing amounts of iron were determined in vitro. Suspensions of these particles were injected into tumor-bearing mice and tracked longitudinally over 7 days by MRI. Heat-generating abilities of these nanomaterials following exposure to near infrared (NIR) laser irradiation was determined in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The magnetic resonance contrast properties of carbon nanotubes were directly related to their iron content. Iron-containing nanotubes were functional T2-weighted contrast agents in vitro and could be imaged in vivo long-term following injection. Iron content of nanotubes did not affect their ability to generate thermoablative temperatures following exposure to NIR and significant tumor regression was observed in mice treated with MWCNTs and NIR laser irradiation. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that iron-containing MWCNTs are functional T2-weighted contrast agents and efficient mediators of tumor-specific thermal ablation in vivo.</abstract><notes>Ding, Xuanfeng; Singh, Ravi; Burke, Andrew; Hatcher, Heather; Olson, John; Kraft, Robert A; Schmid, Michael; Carroll, David; Bourland, J Daniel; Akman, Steven; Torti, Frank M; Torti, Suzy V; K99 CA154006-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128428-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA12842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA079448-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32CA079448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; London, England; Nanomedicine (Lond). 2011 Oct;6(8):1341-52.

To address those concerns, membranolytic properties of various poly(beta-L-malic acid) (PMLA) copolymers were extensively investigated as a function of concentration and pH. PMLA, a naturally occurring biodegradable polymer, acquires membranolytic activities after substitution of pendent carboxylates with hydrophobic amino acid derivatives. Ruled by hydrophobization and charge neutralization, membranolysis of PMLA copolymers increased as a function of polymer molecular weight and demonstrated a maximum with 50% substitution of carboxylates. Charge neutralization was achieved either conditionally by pH-dependent protonation or permanently by masking carboxylates. Membranolysis of PMLA copolymers containing tripeptides of leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine were pH-dependent in contrast to pH-independent copolymers of Leucine ethyl ester and Leu-Leu-Leu-NH(2) with permanent charge neutralization. PMLA and tripeptides seemed a unique combination for pH-dependent membranolysis. In contrast to nontoxic pH-dependent PMLA copolymers, pH-independent copolymers were found toxic at high concentration, which is ascribed to their nonspecific disruption of plasma membrane at physiological pH. pH-Dependent copolymers were membranolytically active only at acidic pH typical of maturating endosomes, and are thus devoid of cytotoxicity. The PMLA tripeptide copolymers are useful for safe and efficient cytoplasmic delivery routed through endosome.</abstract><notes>Ding, Hui; Portilla-Arias, Jose; Patil, Rameshwar; Black, Keith L; Ljubimova, Julia Y; Holler, Eggehard; R01 CA 136841/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA123495/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 CA151815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Biomaterials. 2011 Aug;32(22):5269-78.

However, an evolutionary process of creating an efficient microfluidic array for many different bioassays is necessary. Specifically for a complete view of a cell response it is essential to incorporate cytotoxic, protein and gene analysis on a single system. Here we present a novel cellular and molecular analysis platform, which allows access to gene expression, protein immunoassay, and cytotoxicity information in parallel. It is realized by an integrated microfluidic array plate (iMAP). The iMAP enables sample processing of cells, perfusion based cell culture, effective perturbation of biologic molecules or drugs, and simultaneous, real-time optical analysis for different bioassays. The key features of the iMAP design are the interface of on-board gravity driven flow, the open access input fluid exchange and the highly efficient sedimentation based cell capture mechanism ( approximately 100% capture rates). The operation of the device is straightforward (tube and pump free) and capable of handling dilute samples (5-cells per experiment), low reagent volumes (50 nL per reaction), and performing single cell protein and gene expression measurements. We believe that the unique low cell number and triple analysis capabilities of the iMAP platform can enable novel dynamic studies of scarce cells.</abstract><notes>Dimov, Ivan K; Kijanka, Gregor; Park, Younggeun; Ducree, Jens; Kang, Taewook; Lee, Luke P; U54CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; England; Lab on a chip; Lab Chip. 2011 Aug 21;11(16):2701-10.

Using prostate cancer (PCa) as a model disease, we previously described the engineering of aptamer (Apt)-targeted poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-b-PEG) nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating a Pt(IV) prodrug c,t,c[Pt(NH(3))(2)-(O(2)CCH(2)CH(2)CH(2)CH(2)CH(3))(2)Cl(2)] (1) (Pt-PLGA-b-PEG-Apt-NP), which target the extracellular domain of the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), for enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity. Here we demonstrate enhanced in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK), biodistribution, tolerability, and efficacy of Pt-PLGA-b-PEG-Apt-NP (150 +/- 15 nm encapsulating approximately 5% wt/wt Pt(IV) prodrug) when compared to cisplatin administered in its conventional form in normal Sprague Dawley rats, Swiss Albino mice, and the PSMA-expressing LNCaP subcutaneous xenograft mouse model of PCa, respectively. The 10-d maximum tolerated dose following a single i.v. injection of Pt-PLGA-b-PEG-NP in rats and mice was determined at 40 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively. PK studies with Pt-PLGA-b-PEG-NP revealed prolonged Pt persistence in systemic blood circulation and decreased accumulation of Pt in the kidneys, a major target site of cisplatin toxicity. Pt-PLGA-b-PEG-Apt-NPs further displayed the significant dose-sparing characteristics of the drug, with equivalent antitumor efficacy in LNCaP xenografts at 1/3 the dose of cisplatin administered in its conventional form (0.3 mg/kg vs. 1 mg/kg). When considering the simultaneous improvement in tolerability and efficacy, the Pt-PLGA-b-PEG-Apt NP provides a remarkable improvement in the drug therapeutic index.</abstract><notes>Dhar, Shanta; Kolishetti, Nagesh; Lippard, Stephen J; Farokhzad, Omid C; CA034992/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA119349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB003647/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 CA034992-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Feb 1;108(5):1850-5.

Biomedical success at this scale creates synthetic opportunities for combining specifically designed orthogonal reactions in applications such as imaging, diagnostics, and therapy. For practical reasons, it would be helpful if bioorthogonal coupling reactions proceeded with extremely rapid kinetics (k &gt; 10(3) M(-1) s(-1)) and high specificity. Improving kinetics would minimize both the time and amount of labeling agent required to maintain high coupling yields. In this Account, we discuss our recent efforts to design extremely rapid bioorthogonal coupling reactions between tetrazines and strained alkenes. These selective reactions were first used to covalently couple conjugated tetrazine near-infrared-emitting fluorophores to dienophile-modifed extracellular proteins on living cancer cells. Confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated efficient and selective labeling, and control experiments showed minimal background fluorescence. Multistep techniques were optimized to work with nanomolar concentrations of labeling agent over a time scale of minutes: the result was successful real-time imaging of covalent modification. We subsequently discovered fluorogenic probes that increase in fluorescence intensity after the chemical reaction, leading to an improved signal-to-background ratio. Fluorogenic probes were used for intracellular imaging of dienophiles. We further developed strategies to react and image chemotherapeutics, such as trans-cyclooctene taxol analogues, inside living cells. Because the coupling partners are small molecules (&lt;300 Da), they offer unique steric advantages in multistep amplification. We also describe recent success in using tetrazine reactions to label biomarkers on cells with magneto-fluorescent nanoparticles. Two-step protocols that use bioorthogonal chemistry can significantly amplify signals over both one-step labeling procedures as well as two-step procedures that use more sterically hindered biotin-avidin interactions. Nanoparticles can be detected with fluorescence or magnetic resonance techniques. These strategies are now being routinely used on clinical samples for biomarker profiling to predict malignancy and patient outcome. Finally, we discuss recent results with tetrazine reactions used for in vivo molecular imaging applications. Rapid tetrazine cycloadditions allow modular labeling of small molecules with the most commonly used positron emission tomography isotope, (18)F. Additionally, recent work has applied this reaction directly in vivo for the pretargeted imaging of solid tumors. Future work with tetrazine cycloadditions will undoubtedly lead to optimized protocols, improved probes, and additional biomedical applications.</abstract><notes>Devaraj, Neal K; Weissleder, Ralph; K01 EB010078-01/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; K01 EB010078-04/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; K01EB010078/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; P50 CA086355-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50CA86355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 EB010011-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB010011-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01EB010011/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; T32 CA079443-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32CA079443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Acc Chem Res. 2011 Sep 20;44(9):816-27.

Recently, these materials have been scaled down to nanometer sizes, and this Account details the development of nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (NMOFs) for biomedical applications. NMOFs possess several potential advantages over conventional nanomedicines such as their structural and chemical diversity, their high loading capacity, and their intrinsic biodegradability. Under relatively mild conditions, NMOFs can be obtained as either crystalline or amorphous materials. The particle composition, size, and morphology can be easily tuned to optimize the final particle properties. Researchers have employed two general strategies to deliver active agents using NMOFs: by incorporating active agents into the frameworks or by loading active agents into the pores and channels of the NMOFs. The modification of NMOF surfaces with either silica coatings or organic polymers improves NMOF stability, fine-tunes their properties, and imparts additional functionality. Preliminary biomedical applications of NMOFs have focused on their use as delivery vehicles for imaging contrast agents and molecular therapeutics. Because NMOFs can carry large amounts of paramagnetic metal ions, they have been extensively explored as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. Both Gd(3+)- and Mn(2+)-containing NMOFs have shown excellent efficacy as T(1)-weighted contrast agents with large per metal- and per particle-based MR relaxivities. Fe(3+)-containing NMOFs have demonstrated excellent T(2)-weighted contrast enhancement. Upon intravenous injection of iron carboxylate NMOFs in Wistar rats, researchers observed negative signal enhancement in the liver and spleen, which dissipated over time, indicating the degradation and clearance of the NMOF. Through the incorporation of luminescent or high Z element building blocks, NMOFs have also served as viable contrast agents for optical imaging or X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging. Incorporation of membrane impermeable dyes into NMOFs allowed for their uptake by cancer cells and for their controlled release as the framework decomposed. NMOFs have been used to deliver anticancer drugs and other chemotherapeutics. Cisplatin prodrugs were incorporated within NMOFs at exceptionally high levels, either through use of the prodrug as the building block or through attachment of the prodrug onto the framework after synthesis. These NMOFs were encapsulated within a silica shell and targeted to cancer cells. In vitro assays revealed that the targeted NMOFs possessed similar efficacy to cisplatin, while the nontargeted NMOFs were less active. Several different therapeutic molecules were loaded within porous iron-carboxylate NMOFs at unprecedented levels. The NMOF showed sustained drug release with no burst effect, and in vitro assays revealed that the nanoencapsulated drug possessed similar efficacy to the free drug. Although still at a very early stage of development, NMOFs have already shown great promise as a novel platform for nanomedicine. The compositional tunability and mild synthetic conditions used to produce NMOFs should allow for the incorporation of other imaging and therapeutic agents and their effective delivery to targeted cells in vivo.</abstract><notes>Della Rocca, Joseph; Liu, Demin; Lin, Wenbin; U01-CA151455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54-151652/PHS HHS/; Acc Chem Res. 2011 Oct 18;44(10):957-68.

In addition to progress in single mode contrast agents, which ushered in unprecedented R(1) or R(2) sensitivities, there has also been a boon in the development of agents covering more than one mode of detection. These include T(1)-PET, T(2)-PET T(1)-optical, T(2)-optical, T(1)-T(2) agents and many others. In this review, we describe four areas which we feel have experienced particular growth due to nanotechnology, specifically T(2) magnetic nanostructure development, T(1)/T(2)-optical dual mode agents, and most recently the T(1)-T(2) hybrid imaging systems. In each of these systems, we describe applications including in vitro, in vivo usage and assay development. In all, while the benefits and drawbacks of most MRI contrast agents depend on the application at hand, the recent development in multimodal nanohybrids may curtail the shortcomings of single mode agents in diagnostic and clinical settings by synergistically incorporating functionality. It is hoped that as nanotechnology advances over the next decade, it will produce agents with increased diagnostics and assay relevant capabilities in streamlined packages that can meaningfully improve patient care and prognostics. In this review article, we focus on T(2) materials, its surface functionalization and coupling with optical and/or T(1) agents.</abstract><notes>De, Mrinmoy; Chou, Stanley S; Joshi, Hrushikesh M; Dravid, Vinayak P; Netherlands; Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2011 Nov;63(14-15):1282-99.

Specifically, we have shown that GO can act as an artificial receptor and inhibit the activity of alpha-chymotrypsin (ChT), a serine protease. Most significantly, our data demonstrate that GO exhibits the highest inhibition dose response (by weight) for ChT inhibition compared with all other reported artificial inhibitors. Through fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism studies, we have shown that this protein-receptor interaction is highly biocompatible and conserves the protein&apos;s secondary structure over extended periods (&gt;24 h). We have also explored GO-enzyme interactions by controlling the ionic strength of the medium, which attenuates the host-guest electrostatic interactions.

Here we summarize the vast applications of advanced nanoparticles with a focus on carbon nanotube (CNT)-based or CNT-catalyzed contrast agents for photoacoustic (PA) imaging, cytometry and theranostics applications based on the photothermal (PT) effect. We briefly review the safety and potential toxicity of the PA/PT contrast nanoagents, while showing how the physical properties as well as multiple biological coatings change their toxicity profiles and contrasts. We provide general guidelines needed for the validation of a new molecular imaging agent in living subjects, and exemplify these guidelines with single-walled CNTs targeted to alpha(v) beta(3) , an integrin associated with tumor angiogenesis, and golden carbon nanotubes targeted to LYVE-1, endothelial lymphatic receptors. An extensive review of the potential applications of advanced contrast agents is provided, including imaging of static targets such as tumor angiogenesis receptors, in vivo cytometry of dynamic targets such as circulating tumor cells and nanoparticles in blood, lymph, bones and plants, methods to enhance the PA and PT effects with transient and stationary bubble conjugates, PT/PA Raman imaging and multispectral histology.

Although recent reports have shown that the fibrotic reaction can limit the efficacy of gemcitabine chemotherapy, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this article, we show that the type I collagen allows PDAC cells to override checkpoint arrest induced by gemcitabine. Relative to cells grown on tissue culture plastic, PDAC cells grown in 3-dimensional collagen microenvironment have minimal Chk1 phosphorylation and continue to proliferate in the presence of gemcitabine. Collagen increases membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP)-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation to limit the effect of gemcitabine. Collagen also increases MT1-MMP-dependent high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) expression, a nonhistone DNA-binding nuclear protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription, to attenuate the effect of gemcitabine. Overexpression of MT1-MMP in the collagen microenvironment increases ERK1/2 phosphorylation and HMGA2 expression, and thereby further attenuates gemcitabine-induced checkpoint arrest. MT1-MMP also allows PDAC cells to continue to proliferate in the presence of gemcitabine in a xenograft mouse model. Clinically, human tumors with increased MT1-MMP show increased HMGA2 expression. Overall, our data show that collagen upregulation of MT1-MMP contributes to gemcitabine resistance in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model, and suggest that targeting MT1-MMP could be a novel approach to sensitize pancreatic tumors to gemcitabine.</abstract><notes>Dangi-Garimella, Surabhi; Krantz, Seth B; Barron, Morgan R; Shields, Mario A; Heiferman, Michael J; Grippo, Paul J; Bentrem, David J; Munshi, Hidayatullah G; R01 CA126888-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA126888-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA126888-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA126888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Res. 2011 Feb 1;71(3):1019-28.

The purpose of this study was to develop a clinically applicable, noninvasive diagnostic assay for selective targeting and visualization of TAMs in breast cancer, based on magnetic resonanceI and clinically applicable iron oxide nanoparticles. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: F4/80-negative mammary carcinoma cells and F4/80-positive TAMs were incubated with iron oxide nanoparticles and were compared with respect to magnetic resonance signal changes and iron uptake. MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice harboring mammary carcinomas underwent nanoparticle-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) up to 1 hour and 24 hours after injection. The tumor enhancement on MRIs was correlated with the presence and location of TAMs and nanoparticles by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: In vitro studies revealed that iron oxide nanoparticles are preferentially phagocytosed by TAMs but not by malignant tumor cells. In vivo, all tumors showed an initial contrast agent perfusion on immediate postcontrast MRIs with gradual transendothelial leakage into the tumor interstitium. Twenty-four hours after injection, all tumors showed a persistent signal decline on MRIs. TAM depletion via alphaCSF1 monoclonal antibodies led to significant inhibition of tumor nanoparticle enhancement. Detection of iron using 3,3&apos;-diaminobenzidine-enhanced Prussian Blue staining, combined with immunodetection of CD68, localized iron oxide nanoparticles to TAMs, showing that the signal effects on delayed MRIs were largely due to TAM-mediated uptake of contrast agent. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that tumor enhancement with clinically applicable iron oxide nanoparticles may serve as a new biomarker for long-term prognosis, related treatment decisions, and the evaluation of new immune-targeted therapies.</abstract><notes>Daldrup-Link, Heike E; Golovko, Daniel; Ruffell, Brian; Denardo, David G; Castaneda, Rosalinda; Ansari, Celina; Rao, Jianghong; Tikhomirov, Grigory A; Wendland, Michael F; Corot, Claire; Coussens, Lisa M; P50 CA 58207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; P50 CA58207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R01 CA140943-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R01CA130980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R01CA132566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R01CA140943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R21 CA156124-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R21 CA156124-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R21CA156124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; U54 CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; U54 CA151459-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.; United States; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research; Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Sep 1;17(17):5695-704.

It is believed that noninvasive imaging techniques, which offer the ability to track the status of cells after transplantation, will expedite progress in this field and help to achieve maximized therapeutic effect. Today&apos;s biomedical imaging technology allows for real-time, noninvasive monitoring of grafted stem cells including their biodistribution, migration, survival, and differentiation, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of nanoparticle-labeled cells being one of the most commonly used techniques. Among the advantages of MR cell tracking are its high spatial resolution, no exposure to ionizing radiation, and clinical applicability. In order to track cells by MRI, the cells need to be labeled with magnetic nanoparticles, for which many types exist. There are several cellular labeling techniques available, including simple incubation, use of transfection agents, magnetoelectroporation, and magnetosonoporation. In this overview article, we will review the use of different magnetic nanoparticles and discuss how these particles can be used to track the distribution of transplanted cells in different organ systems. Caveats and limitations inherent to the tracking of nanoparticle-labeled stem cells are also discussed.</abstract><notes>Cromer Berman, Stacey M&#xD;Walczak, Piotr&#xD;Bulte, Jeff W M&#xD;R01 DA026299-04/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 NS045062-08/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;Wiley Interdiscip Rev Nanomed Nanobiotechnol. 2011 Jul-Aug;3(4):343-55. doi: 10.1002/wnan.140.

The physical conjugation between a protein and its own RNA presents unique challenges in manipulating the displayed proteins at a low nanomolar scale in an RNase-free environment. The following protocol outlines the generation of cDNA libraries derived from natural organisms as well as the steps required for generation of mRNA-protein fusion molecules, in vitro functional selection and regeneration of the selected cDNA library. The selection procedures for the identification of protease substrates and Ca(2+)-dependent calmodulin-binding proteins from natural cDNA libraries are presented as examples.

The great interest in miRNAs reflects their central role in gene-expression regulation and the implication of miRNA-specific aberrant expression in the pathogenesis of cancer, cardiac, immune-related and other diseases. Another avenue of current research is the study of circulating miRNAs in serum, plasma, and other body fluids--miRNAs may act not only within cells, but also at other sites within the body. The presence of miRNAs in body fluids may represent a gold mine of noninvasive biomarkers in cancer. Since deregulated miRNA expression is an early event in tumorigenesis, measuring circulating miRNA levels may also be useful for early cancer detection, which can contribute greatly to the success of treatment. In this Review, we discuss the role of fluid-expressed miRNAs as reliable cancer biomarkers and treatment-response predictors as well as potential new patient selection criteria for clinical trials. In addition, we explore the concept that miRNAs could function as hormones.</abstract><notes>Cortez, Maria Angelica; Bueso-Ramos, Carlos; Ferdin, Jana; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K; Calin, George A; CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2011 Jun 7;8(8):467-77. doi: 10.1038/nrclinonc.2011.76.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.; Review</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21647195</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrclinonc.2011.76</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>541</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">541</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Constantinou, P.

Notable examples of these mucins are MUC1, MUC4 and MUC16 (also known as cancer antigen 125). In adenocarcinomas, apical mucin restriction is lost and overall expression is often highly increased. High-level mucin expression protects tumors from killing by the host immune system, as well as by chemotherapeutic agents, and affords protection from apoptosis. Mucin expression can increase as the result of gene duplication and/or in response to hormones, cytokines and growth factors prevalent in the tumor milieu. Rises in the normally low levels of mucin fragments in serum have been used as markers of disease, such as tumor burden, for many years.

Selection for drug-resistant mutations, activation of feedback loops, and upregulation of cross-talk pathways provide escape routes by which cancer cells maintain signal flux through critical downstream effectors to promote therapeutic resistance. Attempts to target signal transduction pathways in cancer may therefore require investigators to aim at a moving target. We need to anticipate the routes of resistance to guide the selection of drugs that will lead to durable therapeutic response. In this New Strategies article, we discuss the challenges imposed by the complexity and adaptive capacity of cancer and suggest potential new diagnostic strategies to more effectively guide targeted cancer therapy. We focus on glioblastoma, the most common malignant primary brain tumor of adults. Glioblastoma is a model for a pathway-driven, molecularly heterogeneous cancer for which new genomic insights obtained through The Cancer Genome Atlas are ripe for integration with functional biology and incorporation into new molecular diagnostic assays.</abstract><notes>Cloughesy, Timothy F; Mischel, Paul S; R01 NS050151-05/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; U54 CA119347-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Jan 1;17(1):6-11.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21208902</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3075730</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2268</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>784</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">784</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chung, H.

Here we describe the bioorthogonal modification of small molecule antibiotics (vancomycin and daptomycin), which bind to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. The bound antibiotics conjugates can be reacted orthogonally with tetrazine-modified nanoparticles, via an almost instantaneous cycloaddition, which subsequently renders the bacteria detectable by optical or magnetic sensing. We show that this approach is specific, selective, fast and biocompatible. Furthermore, it can be adapted to the detection of intracellular pathogens. Importantly, this strategy enables detection of entire classes of bacteria, a feat that is difficult to achieve using current antibody approaches. Compared to covalent nanoparticle conjugates, our bioorthogonal method demonstrated 1-2 orders of magnitude greater sensitivity. This bioorthogonal labeling method could ultimately be applied to a variety of other small molecules with specificity for infectious pathogens, enabling their detection and diagnosis.</abstract><notes>Chung, Hyun Jung; Reiner, Thomas; Budin, Ghyslain; Min, Changwook; Liong, Monty; Issadore, David; Lee, Hakho; Weissleder, Ralph; HHSN268201000044C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; HHSN268201000044C/PHS HHS/; R01 EB004626-07/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626-08/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB010011-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01-EB00462605A1/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01-EB010011/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2011 Nov 22;5(11):8834-41.

The membrane is formed with hyaluronic acid and peptide amphiphiles with binding affinity for heparin, and its hierarchical structure contains both an amorphous zone and a layer of fibrils oriented perpendicular to the membrane plane. The design of bioactivity is based on the potential ability to bind and slowly release heparin-binding growth factors. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) seeded on these membranes attached and remained viable. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were incorporated within the membrane structure prior to self-assembly and released into media over a prolonged period of time (14 days). Using the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, we also found that these membranes induced a significant and rapid enhancement of angiogenesis relative to controls.</abstract><notes>Chow, Lesley W&#xD;Bitton, Ronit&#xD;Webber, Matthew J&#xD;Carvajal, Daniel&#xD;Shull, Kenneth R&#xD;Sharma, Arun K&#xD;Stupp, Samuel I&#xD;1R01EB003806/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB003806-04/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Biomaterials. 2011 Feb;32(6):1574-82.

Investigations on how the physicochemical properties (e.g., size, surface charge, shape, and density of targeting ligands) of nanoparticles enable their ability to overcome biological barriers and reach designated cellular destinations in sufficient amounts to elicit biological efficacy are of interest. Despite proven success in nanoparticle accumulation at cellular locations and occurrence of downstream therapeutic effects (e.g., target gene inhibition) in a selected few organs such as tumor and liver, reports on effective delivery of engineered nanoparticles to other organs still remain scarce. Here, we show that nanoparticles of ~75 +/- 25-nm diameters target the mesangium of the kidney. These data show the effects of particle diameter on targeting the mesangium of the kidney. Because many diseases originate from this area of the kidney, our findings establish design criteria for constructing nanoparticle-based therapeutics for targeting diseases that involve the mesangium of the kidney.</abstract><notes>Choi, Chung Hang J; Zuckerman, Jonathan E; Webster, Paul; Davis, Mark E; 2P30DC006272-06/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/; CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Apr 19;108(16):6656-61.

Efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas Project will identify genes with aberrant copy number, sequence, or expression in various cancer types, providing a survey of the genes that may have a causal role in cancer. A complementary approach is to perform systematic loss-of-function studies to identify essential genes in particular cancer cell types. We have begun a systematic effort, termed Project Achilles, aimed at identifying genetic vulnerabilities across large numbers of cancer cell lines. Here, we report the assessment of the essentiality of 11,194 genes in 102 human cancer cell lines. We show that the integration of these functional data with information derived from surveying cancer genomes pinpoints known and previously undescribed lineage-specific dependencies across a wide spectrum of cancers. In particular, we found 54 genes that are specifically essential for the proliferation and viability of ovarian cancer cells and also amplified in primary tumors or differentially overexpressed in ovarian cancer cell lines. One such gene, PAX8, is focally amplified in 16% of high-grade serous ovarian cancers and expressed at higher levels in ovarian tumors. Suppression of PAX8 selectively induces apoptotic cell death of ovarian cancer cells. These results identify PAX8 as an ovarian lineage-specific dependency. More generally, these observations demonstrate that the integration of genome-scale functional and structural studies provides an efficient path to identify dependencies of specific cancer types on particular genes and pathways.</abstract><notes>Cheung, Hiu Wing; Cowley, Glenn S; Weir, Barbara A; Boehm, Jesse S; Rusin, Scott; Scott, Justine A; East, Alexandra; Ali, Levi D; Lizotte, Patrick H; Wong, Terence C; Jiang, Guozhi; Hsiao, Jessica; Mermel, Craig H; Getz, Gad; Barretina, Jordi; Gopal, Shuba; Tamayo, Pablo; Gould, Joshua; Tsherniak, Aviad; Stransky, Nicolas; Luo, Biao; Ren, Yin; Drapkin, Ronny; Bhatia, Sangeeta N; Mesirov, Jill P; Garraway, Levi A; Meyerson, Matthew; Lander, Eric S; Root, David E; Hahn, William C; R33 CA128625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2 CA148268/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA112962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jul 26;108(30):12372-7.

In particular, mechanical injury from the procedure results in extensive endothelial denudation, exposing the underlying collagen IV-rich basal lamina, which promotes both intravascular thrombosis and smooth muscle proliferation. Previously, we reported the engineering of collagen IV-targeting nanoparticles (NPs) and demonstrated their preferential localization to sites of arterial injury. Here, we develop a systemically administered, targeted NP system to deliver an antiproliferative agent to injured vasculature. Approximately 60-nm lipid-polymeric NPs were surface functionalized with collagen IV-targeting peptides and loaded with paclitaxel. In safety studies, the targeted NPs showed no signs of toxicity and a &gt;/=3.5-fold improved maximum tolerated dose versus paclitaxel. In efficacy studies using a rat carotid injury model, paclitaxel (0.3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg) was i.v. administered postprocedure on days 0 and 5. The targeted NP group resulted in lower neointima-to-media (N/M) scores at 2 wk versus control groups of saline, paclitaxel, or nontargeted NPs. Compared with sham-injury groups, an approximately 50% reduction in arterial stenosis was observed with targeted NP treatment. The combination of improved tolerability, sustained release, and vascular targeting could potentially provide a safe and efficacious option in the management of CAD.</abstract><notes>Chan, Juliana M; Rhee, June-Wha; Drum, Chester L; Bronson, Roderick T; Golomb, Gershon; Langer, Robert; Farokhzad, Omid C; CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB003647/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Howard Hughes Medical Institute/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Nov 29;108(48):19347-52.

A critical need exists to identify novel targets that curb the progression and metastasis of ovarian cancer. In this study, we examined whether the nuclear receptor coregulator PELP1 (proline-, glutamic acid-, leucine-rich protein-1) contributes to progression and metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells and determined whether blocking of the PELP1 signaling axis had a therapeutic effect. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ovarian cancer cells stably expressing PELP1-shRNA (short hairpin RNA) were established. Fluorescent microscopy, Boyden chamber, invasion assays, wound healing, and zymography assays were performed to examine the role of PELP1 in metastasis. Expression analysis of the model cells was conducted using tumor metastasis microarray to identify PELP1 Target genes. Therapeutic potential of PELP1-siRNA in vivo was determined using a nanoliposomal formulation of PELP1-siRNA-DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine) administered systemically in a xenograft model. RESULTS: PELP1 knockdown caused cytoskeletal defects and significantly affected the migratory potential of ovarian cancer cells. Microarray analysis revealed that PELP1 affected the expression of selective genes involved in metastasis including Myc, MTA1, MMP2, and MMP9. Zymography analysis confirmed that PELP1 knockdown caused a decrease in the activation of matrix metalloproteases (MMP) 2 and MMP9. Compared with control siRNA-DOPC-treated mice, animals injected with PELP1-siRNA-DOPC had 54% fewer metastatic tumor nodules, exhibited a 51% reduction in tumor growth and an 84% reduction in ascites volume. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that PELP1 signaling axis is a potential druggable target and liposomal PELP1-siRNA-DOPC could be used as a novel drug to prevent or treat ovarian metastasis.</abstract><notes>Chakravarty, Dimple; Roy, Sudipa Saha; Babu, Challa Ram; Dandamudi, Rajasekhar; Curiel, Tyler J; Vivas-Mejia, Pablo; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K; Vadlamudi, Ratna K; CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; NIH-CA0095681/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P30CA54174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA095681-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA095681-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Apr 15;17(8):2250-9.

Such control, however, remains a challenge in nanobiotechnology due to the limitations of current lithographic techniques. Herein we report an approach that combines scanning probe block copolymer lithography with site-selective immobilization strategies to create arrays of proteins down to the single-molecule level with arbitrary pattern control. Scanning probe block copolymer lithography was used to synthesize individual sub-10-nm single crystal gold nanoparticles that can act as scaffolds for the adsorption of functionalized alkylthiol monolayers, which facilitate the immobilization of specific proteins. The number of protein molecules that adsorb onto the nanoparticles is dependent upon particle size; when the particle size approaches the dimensions of a protein molecule, each particle can support a single protein. This was demonstrated with both gold nanoparticle and quantum dot labeling coupled with transmission electron microscopy imaging experiments. The immobilized proteins remain bioactive, as evidenced by enzymatic assays and antigen-antibody binding experiments. Importantly, this approach to generate single-biomolecule arrays is, in principle, applicable to many parallelized cantilever and cantilever-free scanning probe molecular printing methods.</abstract><notes>Chai, Jinan&#xD;Wong, Lu Shin&#xD;Giam, Louise&#xD;Mirkin, Chad A&#xD;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Dec 6;108(49):19521-5.

However, the peptides they display are not very immunogenic because they normally fail to present foreign epitopes at the very high densities required for efficient B-cell activation. Meanwhile, systems based on virus-like particles (VLPs) permit the engineered high-density display of specific epitopes but are incapable of peptide library display and affinity selection. We developed a new peptide display platform based on VLPs of the RNA bacteriophage MS2. It combines the high immunogenicity of MS2 VLPs with the affinity selection capabilities of other phage display systems. Here, we describe plasmid vectors that facilitate the construction of high-complexity random sequence peptide libraries on MS2 VLPs and that allow control of the stringency of affinity selection through the manipulation of display valency. We used the system to identify epitopes for several previously characterized monoclonal antibody targets and showed that the VLPs thus obtained elicit antibodies in mice whose activities mimic those of the selecting antibodies.</abstract><notes>Chackerian, Bryce; Caldeira, Jerri do Carmo; Peabody, Julianne; Peabody, David S; R01 AI083305/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/; R01 AI083305-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/; R01 AI08335/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/; R01 GM042901/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM042901-19/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; England; J Mol Biol. 2011 Jun 3;409(2):225-37.

The disposition of encapsulated drug is dictated by the composition of the liposome, thus altering the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the drug. Allometric scaling is based on a power-log relationship between body weight (W) and drug clearance (CL) among mammals and has been used to compare the disposition of nonliposomal drugs across species. The objectives of this study were to use allometric scaling to: (1) compare the disposition of pegylated liposomal drugs across speciesand determine the best scaling model and (2) predict PK parameters of pegylated liposomal drugs in humans. The PK of pegylated liposomal CKD-602 (S-CKD602), doxorubicin (Doxil(R)), and cisplatin (SPI-077) were compared. PK studies ofS-CKD602, Doxil(R), and SPI-077 were performed at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in male and female mice, rats, dogs and patients with refractory solid tumors. The allometric equation used to evaluate the relationship between W and CL in each species was CL = a(W)(m) (a = empirical coefficient; m = allometric exponent). Substitution of physiological variables other than body weight, such as factors representative of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) were evaluated. Dedrick Plots and Maximum Life-Span Potential (MLP) were used to determine scaling feasibility. Standard allometry demonstrated a relationship between clearance of S-CKD602, Doxil(R), and SPI-077 and body, spleen, liver, and kidney weights, total monocyte count, and spleen and liver blood flow. However, using scaling to predict CL of these agents in humans often resulted in differences &gt;30%. Despite a strong correlation between body weight and MPS-associated variables with CL among preclinical species, the use of the equations did not predict CL. Thus, new methods of allometric scaling and measures of MPS function need to be developed.</abstract><notes>Caron, Whitney P; Clewell, Harvey; Dedrick, Robert; Ramanathan, Ramesh K; Davis, Whitney L; Yu, Ning; Tonda, Margaret; Schellens, Jan H; Beijnen, Jos H; Zamboni, William C; J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn. 2011 Oct;38(5):653-69.

MWCNTs are being explored for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Successful biomedical application of MWCNTs will require compatibility with normal circulatory components, including constituents of the hemostatic cascades. In this manuscript, we compare the thrombotic activity of MWCNTs in vitro and in vivo. We also assess the influence of functionalization of MWCNTs on thrombotic activity. In vitro, MWCNT activate the intrinsic pathway of coagulation as measured by activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assays. Functionalization by amidation or carboxylation enhances this procoagulant activity. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that MWCNTs enhance propagation of the intrinsic pathway via a non-classical mechanism strongly dependent on factor IX. MWCNTs preferentially associate with factor IXa and may provide a platform that enhances its enzymatic activity. In addition to their effects on the coagulation cascade, MWCNTs activate platelets in vitro, with amidated MWCNTs exhibiting greater platelet activation than carboxylated or pristine MWCNTs. However, contrasting trends are obtained in vivo, where functionalization tends to diminish rather than enhance procoagulant activity. Thus, following systemic injection of MWCNTs in mice, pristine MWCNTs decreased platelet counts, increased vWF, and increased D-dimers. In contrast, carboxylated MWCNTS exhibited little procoagulant tendency in vivo, eliciting only a mild and transient decrease in platelets. Amidated MWCNTs elicited no statistically significant change in platelet count. Further, neither carboxylated nor amidated MWCNTs increased vWF or D-dimers in mouse plasma. We conclude that the procoagulant tendencies of MWCNTs observed in vitro are not necessarily recapitulated in vivo. Further, functionalization can markedly attenuate the procoagulant activity of MWCNTs in vivo. This work will inform the rational development of biocompatible MWCNTs for systemic delivery.</abstract><notes>Burke, Andrew R; Singh, Ravi N; Carroll, David L; Owen, John D; Kock, Nancy D; D&apos;Agostino, Ralph Jr; Torti, Frank M; Torti, Suzy V; K99 CA154006-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; K99 CA154006-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; K99CA154006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128428-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA12842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32CA079448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Biomaterials. 2011 Sep;32(26):5970-8.

At least 6 clinical trials have been published at the end of 2010, all of which have shown that real-time monitoring of the injection procedure, initial engraftment, and short-term biodistribution of cells is critical to further advance the field of cellular therapeutics. In MRI cell tracking, cells are loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles that provide an MRI contrast effect through microscopic magnetic field disturbances and dephasing of protons. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has recently emerged as a potential cellular imaging technique that promises to have several advantages over MRI, primarily linear quantification of cells, a higher sensitivity, and &quot;hot spot&quot; tracer identification without confounding background signal. Although probably not fully optimized, SPIO particles that are currently used as MRI contrast agent can be employed as MPI tracer. Initial studies have shown that cells loaded with SPIO particles can give a detectable MPI signal, encouraging further development of MPI cell tracking.</abstract><notes>Bulte, Jeff W M&#xD;Walczak, Piotr&#xD;Gleich, Bernhard&#xD;Weizenecker, Jurgen&#xD;Markov, Denis E&#xD;Aerts, Hans C J&#xD;Boeve, Hans&#xD;Borgert, Jorn&#xD;Kuhn, Michael&#xD;R01 DA026299-02/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 DA026299-03/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/&#xD;Proc Soc Photo Opt Instrum Eng. 2011;7965:79650z.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22389573</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3290405</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/12.879844</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>320</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">320</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boso, D.

Identifying the optimal configuration that maximizes nanoparticle accumulation at the diseased site is of vital importance. In this work, using a parallel plate flow chamber apparatus, it is demonstrated that an optimal particle diameter (d(opt)) exists for which the number (n(s)) of nanoparticles adhering to the vessel walls is maximized. Such a diameter depends on the wall shear rate (S). Artificial neural networks are proposed as a tool to predict n(s) as a function of S and particle diameter (d), from which to eventually derive d(opt). Artificial neural networks are trained using data from flow chamber experiments. Two networks are used, ie, ANN231 and ANN2321, exhibiting an accurate prediction for n(s) and its complex functional dependence on d and S. This demonstrates that artificial neural networks can be used effectively to minimize the number of experiments needed without compromising the accuracy of the study. A similar procedure could potentially be used equally effectively for in vivo analysis.</abstract><notes>Boso, Daniela P; Lee, Sei-Young; Ferrari, Mauro; Schrefler, Bernhard A; Decuzzi, Paolo; New Zealand; Int J Nanomedicine. 2011;6:1517-26.

Viral delivery systems have shown immunogenicity and toxicity dangers, but synthetic vectors have lagged in transfection efficiency. Previously, we developed a modular, linear-dendritic block copolymer architecture with high gene transfection efficiency compared to commercial standards. This rationally designed system makes use of a cationic dendritic block to condense the anionic DNA and forms complexes with favorable endosomal escape properties. The linear block provides biocompatibility and protection from serum proteins, and can be functionalized with a targeting ligand. In this work, we quantitate performance of this system with respect to intracellular barriers to gene delivery using both high-throughput and traditional approaches. An image-based, high-throughput assay for endosomal escape is described and applied to the block copolymer system. Nuclear entry is demonstrated to be the most significant barrier to more efficient delivery and will be addressed in future versions of the system.</abstract><notes>Bonner, Daniel K; Leung, Cheuk; Chen-Liang, Jane; Chingozha, Loice; Langer, Robert; Hammond, Paula T; 1U54CA151884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01EB008082/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Bioconjug Chem. 2011 Aug 17;22(8):1519-25.

In this paper, we describe a simple method of synthesizing a hydrazine-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol)-phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE)-based amphiphilic polymer which can conjugate a variety of ligands via a reversible, pH-cleavable bond. In this method, the targeting ligand is attached to the distal end of the PEG chain, which facilitates its easy access to the targeted site of interaction. The reversible attachment of targeting ligands is useful especially in multifunctional liposomal systems, whereafter successfully performing the function of targeting to the specific site, the bulky ligands, such as proteins or antibodies, are cleaved off in response to an environmental stimulus to expose some other functionalities such as ligands for intracellular penetration or organelle-specific targeting. To investigate the applicability of the protocol, the model ligands monoclonal antinucleosome antibody 2C5 and antimyosin antibody 2G4, and glycoproteins concanavalin A (Con-A) and avidin were conjugated to the synthesized polymer and incorporated into liposomes. In vitro assays including biochemical, enzyme-linked immunosorbent, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry were used to confirm three key characteristics of the modified and/or liposome-attached proteins: successful conjugation of the targeting ligands to the polymer, preservation of specific activity of the ligands after the conjugation and liposome attachment, and the facile pH-sensitive ligand detachment. Monoclonal antibody 2C5 and 2G4, immobilized on the liposome surface, retained their binding affinity to corresponding antigens as confirmed by ELISA. The Con A-bearing liposomes showed significantly higher agglutination in the presence of its substrate mannan compared to plain liposomes (PL) and avidin-functionalized liposomes bound specifically with biotin-agarose. The study on the pH-dependence showed that almost 80% of the hydrazone bond was cleaved after rather brief preincubation of the immunoliposomes at pH 5 for 0.5 to 1 h. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis of cancer cells (HeLa and MCF-7) treated with cancer cell-specific targeting ligand mAb 2C5-bearing liposomes showed enhanced cellular binding. Studies at low pH clearly confirmed the easy cleavability of the targeting ligand from the liposomes resulting in significantly less or virtually no cellular association.</abstract><notes>Biswas, Swati; Dodwadkar, Namita S; Sawant, Rupa R; Torchilin, Vladimir P; R01 CA 121838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA 128486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA121838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA121838-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128486-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Bioconjug Chem. 2011 Oct 19;22(10):2005-13.

This novel polymer was synthesized by conjugating the mitochondriotropic dye Rh123, with the amphiphilic polyethylene glycol-phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE) conjugate. The modified liposomes showed better uptake by cells (HeLa, B16F10) estimated by fluorescence microscopy and FACS analysis. The co-localization study with stained mitochondria as well as with the isolation of mitochondria of the cultured cells after their treatment with Rh123 liposomes showed a high degree of accumulation of the modified liposomes in the mitochondria. We also prepared mitochondrial-targeted and nontargeted paclitaxel (PCL)-loaded liposomes. Mitochondrial-targeted PCL-loaded liposomes demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity toward cancer cells compared with nontargeted drug-loaded liposomes or free PCL. Thus, Rh123-modified liposomes target mitochondria efficiently and can facilitate the delivery of a therapeutic payload to mitochondria.</abstract><notes>Biswas, Swati; Dodwadkar, Namita S; Sawant, Rupa R; Koshkaryev, Alexander; Torchilin, Vladimir P; R01CA128486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; J Drug Target. 2011 Aug;19(7):552-61.

We demonstrate here a method for the derivation of a predominantly pure population of BFCN from hESC cells using diffusible ligands present in the forebrain at developmentally relevant time periods. Overexpression of two relevant human transcription factors in hESC-derived neural progenitors also generates BFCN. These neurons express only those markers characteristic of BFCN, generate action potentials, and form functional cholinergic synapses in murine hippocampal slice cultures. siRNA-mediated knockdown of the transcription factors blocks BFCN generation by the diffusible ligands, clearly demonstrating the factors both necessary and sufficient for the controlled derivation of this neuronal population. The ability to selectively control the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells [hESC] into BFCN is a significant step both for understanding mechanisms regulating BFCN lineage commitment and for the development of both cell-transplant-mediated therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer&apos;s disease and high throughput screening for agents that promote BFCN survival.</abstract><notes>Journal article; Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio); Stem Cells. 2011 Mar 4. doi: 10.1002/stem.626.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21381151</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>PMC3107131</custom2><electronic-resource-num>; 10.1002/stem.626</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>356</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">356</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bisht, S.</author><author>Khan, M.

However, its development is plagued by poor aqueous solubility resulting in poor bioavailability. To circumvent the suboptimal bioavailability of free curcumin, we have developed a polymeric nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (NanoCurc) that overcomes this major pitfall of the free compound. In this study, we show that NanoCurc results in sustained intrahepatic curcumin levels that can be found in both hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells. NanoCurc markedly inhibits carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis. It also enhances antioxidant levels in the liver and inhibits pro-fibrogenic transcripts associated with activated myofibroblasts. Finally, we show that NanoCurc directly induces stellate cell apoptosis in vitro. Our results suggest that NanoCurc might be an effective therapy for patients with chronic liver disease.</abstract><notes>Bisht, Savita; Khan, Mehtab A; Bekhit, Mena; Bai, Haibo; Cornish, Toby; Mizuma, Masamichi; Rudek, Michelle A; Zhao, Ming; Maitra, Amarnath; Ray, Balmiki; Lahiri, Debomoy; Maitra, Anirban; Anders, Robert A; P01CA134292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P30CA069773/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA134767-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA134767-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA134767-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA134767-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA134767-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 DK080736-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; R01CA113669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA13767/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01DK080736/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; R01DK081417/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; S10 RR026824/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; U54 CA151838-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; UL1RR025005/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; Lab Invest. 2011 Sep;91(9):1383-95. doi: 10.1038/labinvest.2011.86.

The strategy involves pairing an imaging reporter gene with a complementary imaging agent in a system that can be used to measure gene expression or protein interaction or track gene-tagged cells in vivo. Tissue-specific promoters can be used to delineate gene expression in certain tissues, particularly when coupled with an appropriate amplification mechanism. Here we show that the progression elevated gene-3 (PEG-3) promoter, derived from a rodent gene mediating tumor progression and metastatic phenotypes, can be used to drive imaging reporters selectively to enable detection of micrometastatic disease in mouse models of human melanoma and breast cancer using bioluminescence and radionuclide-based molecular imaging techniques. Because of its strong promoter activity, tumor specificity and capacity for clinical translation, PEG-3 promoter-driven gene expression may represent a practical, new system for facilitating cancer imaging and therapy.</abstract><notes>Bhang, Hyo-eun C; Gabrielson, Kathleen L; Laterra, John; Fisher, Paul B; Pomper, Martin G; P01 CA104177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01 CA104177-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01 CA104177-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01 CA104177-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01 CA104177-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA097318-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA127641-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R03 MH093195-02/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/; U24 CA92871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Nat Med. 2011 Jan;17(1):123-9.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cell tracking promises to optimize current cell transplantation paradigms, however, it is limited by dilution of contrast agent during cellular proliferation, transfer of label from dying cells to surrounding endogenous host cells, and/or biodegradation of the label. Here, we evaluated the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging for long-term tracking of transplanted neural stem cells labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide and transfected with the bioluminescence reporter gene luciferase. Mouse neural stem cells were transplanted into immunodeficient, graft-accepting Rag2 mice or immunocompetent, graft-rejecting Balb/c mice. Hypointense voxel signals and bioluminescence were monitored over a period of 93 days. Unexpectedly, in mice that rejected the cells, the hypointense MR signal persisted throughout the entire time-course, whereas in the nonrejecting mice, the contrast cleared at a faster rate. In immunocompetent, graft-rejecting Balb/c mice, infiltrating leukocytes, and microglia were found surrounding dead cells and internalizing superparamagnetic iron oxide clusters. The present results indicate that live cell proliferation and associated label dilution may dominate contrast clearance as compared with cell death and subsequent transfer and retention of superparamagnetic iron oxide within phagocytes and brain interstitium. Thus, interpretation of signal changes during long-term MR cell tracking is complex and requires caution.</abstract><notes>Berman, Stacey Cromer&#xD;Galpoththawela, Chulani&#xD;Gilad, Assaf A&#xD;Bulte, Jeff W M&#xD;Walczak, Piotr&#xD;R01 DA026299-01/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 DA026299-02/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 DA026299-04/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 NS045062-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 NS045062-06A2/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 NS045062-07/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 EB008769-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 NS065284-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/&#xD;Magn Reson Med. 2011 Feb;65(2):564-74. doi: 10.1002/mrm.22613.

Immunocytes (including mononuclear phagocytes (dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages), neutrophils and lymphocytes) are highly mobile; they can migrate across impermeable barriers and release their drug cargo at sites of infection or tissue injury. Thus, immune cells can be exploited as Trojan horses for drug delivery. AREAS COVERED: This paper reviews how immunocytes laden with drugs can cross the blood-brain or blood-tumor barriers to facilitate treatments for infectious diseases, injury, cancer, or inflammatory diseases. The promises and perils of cell-mediated drug delivery are reviewed, with examples of how immunocytes can be harnessed to improve therapeutic end points. EXPERT OPINION: Using cells as delivery vehicles enables targeted drug transport and prolonged circulation times, along with reductions in cell and tissue toxicities. Such systems for drug carriage and targeted release represent a new disease-combating strategy being applied to a spectrum of human disorders. The design of nanocarriers for cell-mediated drug delivery may differ from those used for conventional drug delivery systems; nevertheless, engaging different defense mechanisms in drug delivery may open new perspectives for the active delivery of drugs.</abstract><notes>Batrakova, Elena V; Gendelman, Howard E; Kabanov, Alexander V; 1P01 DA028555/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/; 1P20 RR021937/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; 1R01 CA116591/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; 1R01 NS057748/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; 2R01 CA89225/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; 2R01 NS034239/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; 2R37 NS36126/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; 5P01 DA026146/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/; P01 DA026146-03/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/; P01 DA028555-02/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/; P01 MH064570-09/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/; P01 MH64570/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/; P01 NS031492/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; P01 NS031492-15/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; P01 NS043985-09/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; P01 NS31492/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; P01 NS43985/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; P20 RR015635-10/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; P20 RR021937-04/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; P20 RR15635/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; R01 CA089225-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA116591-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 NS034239-12/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS051334/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS051334-05/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS057748-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R37 NS036126-11/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; U01 CA151806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 CA151806-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Expert Opin Drug Deliv. 2011 Apr;8(4):415-33.

Using perfluorocarbon nanoparticles, we present here a strategy for non-invasive imaging of cells using other modalities. To this end, human cadaveric islets were labeled with rhodamine-perfluorooctylbromide (PFOB) nanoparticles, rhodamine-perfluoropolyether (PFPE) nanoparticles or Feridex as control and tested in vitro for cell viability and c-peptide secretion for 1 week. (19)F MRI, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) imaging was performed on labeled cell phantoms and on cells following transplantation beneath the kidney capsule of mice and rabbits. PFOB and PFPE-labeling did not reduce human islet viability or glucose responsiveness as compared with unlabeled cells or SPIO-labeled cells. PFOB- and PFPE-labeled islets were effectively fluorinated for visualization by (19)F MRI. PFOB-labeled islets were acoustically reflective for detection by US imaging and became sufficiently brominated to become radiopaque allowing visualization with CT. Thus, perfluorocarbon nanoparticles are multimodal cellular contrast agents that may find applications in real-time targeted delivery and imaging of transplanted human islets or other cells in a clinically applicable manner using MRI, US or CT imaging.</abstract><notes>Barnett, Brad P&#xD;Ruiz-Cabello, Jesus&#xD;Hota, Partha&#xD;Ouwerkerk, Ronald&#xD;Shamblott, Michael J&#xD;Lauzon, Cal&#xD;Walczak, Piotr&#xD;Gilson, Wesley D&#xD;Chacko, Vadappuram P&#xD;Kraitchman, Dara L&#xD;Arepally, Aravind&#xD;Bulte, Jeff W M&#xD;R01 EB007825-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB007825-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;Contrast Media Mol Imaging. 2011 Jul-Aug;6(4):251-9. doi: 10.1002/cmmi.424.</notes><work-type>In Vitro</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21861285</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3160722</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/cmmi.424</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1178</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1178</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barnett, B.

Non-invasive cell tracking techniques are, however, necessary to translate this approach to the clinical setting. This protocol details methods to create microcapsules that are visible by X-ray, ultrasound (US) or magnetic resonance (MR) for the encapsulation and immunoisolation of cellular therapeutics. Three steps are generally used to encapsulate cellular therapeutics in an alginate matrix: (i) droplets of cell-containing liquid alginate are extruded, using an electrostatic generator, through a needle tip into a solution containing a dissolved divalent cation salt to form a solid gel; (ii) the resulting gelled spheres are coated with polycations as a cross-linker; and (iii) these complexes are then incubated in a second solution of alginate to form a semipermeable membrane composed of an inner and an outer layer of alginate. The microcapsules can be rendered visible during the first step by adding contrast agents to the primary alginate layer. Such contrast agents include superparamagnetic iron oxide for detection by (1)H MR imaging (MRI); the radiopaque agents barium or bismuth sulfate for detection by X-ray modalities; or perfluorocarbon emulsions for multimodal detection by (19)F MRI, X-ray and US imaging. The entire synthesis can be completed within 2 h.</abstract><notes>Barnett, Brad P&#xD;Arepally, Aravind&#xD;Stuber, Matthias&#xD;Arifin, Dian R&#xD;Kraitchman, Dara L&#xD;Bulte, Jeff W M&#xD;K08 EB004348/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB007825/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB007825-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 HL073223/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 HL084186/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54CA151838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Howard Hughes Medical Institute/&#xD;England&#xD;Nat Protoc. 2011 Jul 14;6(8):1142-51. doi: 10.1038/nprot.2011.352.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21799484</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3193154</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nprot.2011.352</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1177</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1177</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barnard, E.

The resonant properties of such antennas are conventionally characterized by far-field light-scattering techniques. However, many applications require quantitative knowledge of the near-field behaviour, and existing local field measurement techniques provide only relative, rather than absolute, data. Here, we demonstrate a photodetector platform that uses a silicon-on-insulator substrate to spectrally and spatially map the absolute values of enhanced fields near any type of optical antenna by transducing local electric fields into photocurrent. We are able to quantify the resonant optical and materials properties of nanoscale ( approximately 50 nm) and wavelength-scale ( approximately 1 microm) metallic antennas as well as high-refractive-index semiconductor antennas. The data agree well with light-scattering measurements, full-field simulations and intuitive resonator models.</abstract><notes>Barnard, Edward S&#xD;Pala, Ragip A&#xD;Brongersma, Mark L&#xD;England&#xD;Nat Nanotechnol. 2011 Aug 21;6(9):588-93. doi: 10.1038/nnano.2011.131.</notes><work-type>Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21857687</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nnano.2011.131</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>792</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">792</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bardhan, R.</author><author>Lal, S.</author><author>Joshi, A.</author><author>Halas, N.

The theranostic capabilities of gold nanoshells, spherical nanoparticles with silica cores and gold shells, have attracted tremendous attention over the past decade as nanoshells have emerged as a promising tool for cancer therapy and bioimaging enhancement. This Account examines the design and synthesis of nanoshell-based theranostic agents, their plasmon-derived optical properties, and their corresponding applications. We discuss the design and preparation of nanoshell complexes and their ability to enhance the photoluminescence of fluorophores while maintaining their properties as MR contrast agents. In this Account, we discuss the underlying physical principles that contribute to the photothermal response of nanoshells. We then elucidate the photophysical processes that induce nanoshells to enhance the fluorescence of weak near-infrared fluorophores. Nanoshells illuminated with resonant light are either strong optical absorbers or scatterers, properties that give rise to their unique capabilities. These physical processes have been harnessed to visualize and eliminate cancer cells. We describe the application of nanoshells as a contrast agent for optical coherence tomography of breast carcinoma cells in vivo. Our recent studies examine nanoshells as a multimodal theranostic probe, using these nanoparticles for near-infrared fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and for the photothermal ablation of cancer cells. Multimodal nanoshells show theranostic potential for imaging subcutaneous breast cancer tumors in animal models and the distribution of tumors in various tissues. Nanoshells also show promise as light-triggered gene therapy vectors, adding temporal control to the spatial control characteristic of nanoparticle-based gene therapy approaches. We describe the fabrication of DNA-conjugated nanoshell complexes and compare the efficiency of light-induced and thermally-induced release of DNA. Double-stranded DNA nanoshells also provide a way to deliver small molecules into cells: we describe the delivery and light-triggered release of DAPI (4&apos;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), a dye molecule used to stain DNA in the nuclei of cells.</abstract><notes>Bardhan, Rizia; Lal, Surbhi; Joshi, Amit; Halas, Naomi J; R01-CA151962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R42-CA115028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 CA 151886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Acc Chem Res. 2011 Oct 18;44(10):936-46.

Recently, it has been reported that plasmonic NPs conjugated to nuclear-targeting peptides cause DNA damage and apoptotic populations in cancer cells. In the present work, we utilized the plasmonic scattering property and the ability of nuclear-targeted silver nanoparticles (NLS/RGD-AgNPs) to induce programmed cell death in order to image in real-time the behavior of human oral squamous carcinoma (HSC-3) cell communities during and after the induction of apoptosis. Plasmonic live-cell imaging revealed that HSC-3 cells behave as nonprofessional phagocytes. The induction of apoptosis in some cells led to attraction of and their subsequent engulfment by neighboring cells. Attraction to apoptotic cells resulted in clustering of the cellular community. Live-cell imaging also revealed that, as the initial concentration of NLS/RGD-AgNPs increases, the rate of self-killing increases and the degree of attraction and clustering decreases. These results are discussed in terms of the proposed mechanism of cells undergoing programmed cell death.</abstract><notes>Austin, Lauren A; Kang, Bin; Yen, Chun-Wan; El-Sayed, Mostafa A; U01CA151802-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Am Chem Soc. 2011 Nov 9;133(44):17594-7.

However, little is known about the intracellular effects these nanoparticles have on mammalian cells. The aim of this work is to investigate whether silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) conjugated with nuclear and cytoplasmic targeting peptides exhibit the same intracellular effects on cancer cells as peptide-conjugated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Nuclear and cytoplasmic targeting spherical AgNPs with a diameter of 35 nm were incubated in a cancer (HSC-3) and healthy (HaCat) cell line. By utilizing flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and real-time dark field imaging, we were able to analyze how targeting AgNPs affect the cell cycle and cell division. These experiments demonstrated that nuclear-targeting AgNPs cause DNA double-strand breaks and a subsequent increase in the sub G1 (apoptotic) population in our cancer cell model at much lower concentrations than previously reported for nuclear targeting AuNPs. Unlike the M phase accumulation seen in cancer cells treated with AuNPs, an accumulation in the G2 phase of the cell cycle was observed in both cell models when treated with AgNPs. Additionally, real-time dark field imaging showed that cancer cells treated with nuclear targeting AgNPs did not undergo cell division and ultimately underwent programmed cell death. A possible explanation of the observed results is discussed in terms of the chemical properties of the nanoparticles.</abstract><notes>Austin, Lauren A; Kang, Bin; Yen, Chun-Wan; El-Sayed, Mostafa A; U01CA151802-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Bioconjug Chem. 2011 Nov 16;22(11):2324-31.

In-situ grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) is used to follow the self-assembly process in real time to characterize the mechanism of superlattice formation, with the ultimate goal of tailoring film deposition conditions to optimize long-range order. From water, GISAXS data are consistent with a transport-limited assembly process where convective flow directs assembly of VLPs into a lattice oriented with respect to the water drying line. Addition of a nonvolatile solvent (glycerol) modified this assembly pathway, resulting in non-oriented superlattices with improved long-range order. Modification of electrostatic conditions (solution ionic strength, substrate charge) also alters assembly behavior; however, a comparison of in-situ assembly data between VLPs derived from the bacteriophages MS2 and Qbeta show that this assembly process is not fully described by a simple Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek model alone.</abstract><notes>Ashley, Carlee E; Dunphy, Darren R; Jiang, Zhang; Carnes, Eric C; Yuan, Zhen; Petsev, Dimiter N; Atanassov, Plamen B; Velev, Orlin D; Sprung, Michael; Wang, Jin; Peabody, David S; Brinker, C Jeffrey; 2 PN2 EY016570B/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; P41 RR-01081/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; Germany; Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany; Small. 2011 Apr 18;7(8):1043-50. doi: 10.1002/smll.201001665.

To realize this potential, however, targeted nanocarriers must simultaneously overcome multiple challenges, including specificity, stability and a high capacity for disparate cargos. Here we report porous nanoparticle-supported lipid bilayers (protocells) that synergistically combine properties of liposomes and nanoporous particles. Protocells modified with a targeting peptide that binds to human hepatocellular carcinoma exhibit a 10,000-fold greater affinity for human hepatocellular carcinoma than for hepatocytes, endothelial cells or immune cells. Furthermore, protocells can be loaded with combinations of therapeutic (drugs, small interfering RNA and toxins) and diagnostic (quantum dots) agents and modified to promote endosomal escape and nuclear accumulation of selected cargos. The enormous capacity of the high-surface-area nanoporous core combined with the enhanced targeting efficacy enabled by the fluid supported lipid bilayer enable a single protocell loaded with a drug cocktail to kill a drug-resistant human hepatocellular carcinoma cell, representing a 10(6)-fold improvement over comparable liposomes.</abstract><notes>Ashley, Carlee E; Carnes, Eric C; Phillips, Genevieve K; Padilla, David; Durfee, Paul N; Brown, Page A; Hanna, Tracey N; Liu, Juewen; Phillips, Brandy; Carter, Mark B; Carroll, Nick J; Jiang, Xingmao; Dunphy, Darren R; Willman, Cheryl L; Petsev, Dimiter N; Evans, Deborah G; Parikh, Atul N; Chackerian, Bryce; Wharton, Walker; Peabody, David S; Brinker, C Jeffrey; 1U01CA151792-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; 1U19ES019528-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/; 2 PN2 EY016570B/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; U01 CA151792-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 CA151792-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Nat Mater. 2011 May;10(5):389-97.

MS2 VLPs can be rapidly produced in large quantities using in vivo or in vitro synthesis techniques. Their capsids can be modified in precise locations via genetic insertion or chemical conjugation, facilitating the multivalent display of targeting ligands. MS2 VLPs also self-assemble in the presence of nucleic acids to specifically encapsidate siRNA and RNA-modified cargos. Here we report the use of MS2 VLPs to selectively deliver nanoparticles, chemotherapeutic drugs, siRNA cocktails, and protein toxins to human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MS2 VLPs modified with a peptide (SP94) that binds HCC exhibit a 10(4)-fold higher avidity for HCC than for hepatocytes, endothelial cells, monocytes, or lymphocytes and can deliver high concentrations of encapsidated cargo to the cytosol of HCC cells. SP94-targeted VLPs loaded with doxorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil selectively kill the HCC cell line, Hep3B, at drug concentrations &lt;1 nM, while SP94-targeted VLPs that encapsidate a siRNA cocktail, which silences expression of cyclin family members, induce growth arrest and apoptosis of Hep3B at siRNA concentrations &lt;150 pM. Impressively, MS2 VLPs, when loaded with ricin toxin A-chain (RTA) and modified to codisplay the SP94 targeting peptide and a histidine-rich fusogenic peptide (H5WYG) that promotes endosomal escape, kill virtually the entire population of Hep3B cells at an RTA concentration of 100 fM without affecting the viability of control cells. Our results demonstrate that MS2 VLPs, because of their tolerance of multivalent peptide display and their ability to specifically encapsidate a variety of chemically disparate cargos, induce selective cytotoxicity of cancer in vitro and represent a significant improvement in the characteristics of VLP-based delivery systems.</abstract><notes>Ashley, Carlee E; Carnes, Eric C; Phillips, Genevieve K; Durfee, Paul N; Buley, Mekensey D; Lino, Christopher A; Padilla, David P; Phillips, Brandy; Carter, Mark B; Willman, Cheryl L; Brinker, C Jeffrey; Caldeira, Jerri do Carmo; Chackerian, Bryce; Wharton, Walker; Peabody, David S; 2 PN2 EY016570B/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; PN2 EY016570-06/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; R01 GM042901-19/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01 GM42901/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U01 CA151792-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01CA151792-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2011 Jul 26;5(7):5729-45.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Gold nanoparticles functionalized with DTDTPA (dithiolated diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid):gadolinium chelates (GG) were coencapsulated with pancreatic islet cells by using protamine sulfate as a clinical-grade alginate cross linker. Conventional poly-l-lysine-cross-linked microcapsules and unencapsulated islets were included as controls. The viability and glucose responsiveness of islet cells were assessed in vitro, and in vivo insulin (C-peptide) secretion was monitored for 6 weeks in (streptozotocin-induced) diabetic mice with (n = 7) or without (n = 8) intraabdominally engrafted islet cells. Five nondiabetic mice were included as controls. Differences between samples were calculated by using a nonparametric Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney method. To adjust for multiple comparisons, a significance level of P &lt; .01 was chosen. Generalized estimating equations were used to model cell function over time. Three mice with engrafted capsules were imaged in vivo with high-field-strength (9.4-T) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, micro-computed tomography (CT), and 40-MHz ultrasonography (US). RESULTS: Encapsulated human pancreatic islets were functional in vitro for at least 2 weeks after encapsulation. Blood glucose levels in the diabetic mice transplanted with GG-labeled encapsulated mouse betaTC6 insulinoma cells returned to normal within 1 week after transplantation, and normoglycemia was sustained for at least 6 weeks without the use of immunosuppressive drugs. GG microcapsules could be readily visualized with positive-contrast high-field-strength MR imaging, micro-CT, and US both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: Cell encapsulation with GG provides a means of trimodal noninvasive tracking of engrafted cells.</abstract><notes>Arifin, Dian R&#xD;Long, Christopher M&#xD;Gilad, Assaf A&#xD;Alric, Christophe&#xD;Roux, Stephane&#xD;Tillement, Olivier&#xD;Link, Thomas W&#xD;Arepally, Aravind&#xD;Bulte, Jeff W M&#xD;R01 EB007825/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB007825-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;Radiology. 2011 Sep;260(3):790-8.

We describe an integrated robotics/microfluidics platform for the automated preparation of such arrays, and we apply it to the batch fabrication of up to eighteen chips of flow-patterned DNA barcodes. The resulting substrates are comparable in quality with hand-made arrays and exhibit excellent substrate-to-substrate consistency.

Investigations of these nanosystems are rapidly progressing and provide new opportunities in the management of cancer. Tumor-targeted nanosystems are currently designed based primarily on the intrinsic physico-chemical properties of off-the-shelf polymers. Following fabrication, the surfaces of these nanoscale structures are functionalized for passive or active targeted delivery to the tumors. In this Account, we describe a novel approach for the construction of multifunctional polymeric nanosystems based on combinatorial design principles. Combinatorial approaches offer several advantages over conventional methods because they allow for the integration of multiple components with varied properties into a nanosystem via self-assembly or chemical conjugation. High-throughput synthesis and screening is required in polymer design because polymer composition directly affects properties including drug loading, retention in circulation, and targeting of the nanosystems. The first approach relies on the self-assembly of macromolecular building blocks with specific functionalities in aqueous media to yield a large variety of nanoparticle systems. These self-assembled nanosystems with diverse functionalities can then be rapidly screened in a high-throughput fashion for selection of ideal formulations, or hits, which are further evaluated for safety and efficacy. In another approach, a library of a large number of polymeric materials is synthesized using different monomers. Each of the formed polymers is screened for the selection of the best candidates for nanoparticle fabrication. The combinatorial design principles allow for the selection of those nanosystems with the most favorable properties based on the type of payload, route of administration, and the desired target for imaging and delivery.</abstract><notes>Abeylath, Sampath C; Ganta, Srinivas; Iyer, Arun K; Amiji, Mansoor; Acc Chem Res. 2011 Oct 18;44(10):1009-17.

Based on the diversity of the drug payloads, we have investigated a combinatorial-designed strategy where the nano-sized formulations are tailored based on the physicochemical properties of the drug and the delivery needs. Individually functionalized C(2) to C(12) lipid-, thiol-, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modified dextran derivatives were synthesized via &apos;click&apos; chemistry from O-pentynyl dextran and relevant azides. These functionalized dextrans in combination with anticancer drugs form nanoparticles by self-assembling in aqueous medium having PEG surface functionalization and intermolecular disulfide bonds. Using anticancer drugs with logP values ranging from -0.5 to 3.0, the optimized nanoparticles formulations were evaluated for preliminary cellular delivery and cytotoxic effects in SKOV3 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells. The results show that with the appropriate selection of lipid-modified dextran, one can effectively tailor the self-assembled nano-formulation for intended therapeutic payload.</abstract><notes>Abeylath, Sampath C; Amiji, Mansoor M; U01-CA151452/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Bioorg Med Chem. 2011 Nov 1;19(21):6167-73.

The present study demonstrated that 2&apos;-F-modified pRNA nanoparticles were readily manufactured through this scalable bipartite strategy, featuring total chemical synthesis and permitting diverse functional modularizations. The RNA nanoparticles were chemically and metabolically stable and demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in mice (half-life (T(1/2)): 5-10 hours, clearance (Cl): &lt;0.13 l/kg/hour, volume of distribution (V(d)): 1.2 l/kg). It did not induce an interferon (IFN) response nor did it induce cytokine production in mice. Repeat intravenous administrations in mice up to 30 mg/kg did not result in any toxicity. Fluorescent folate-pRNA nanoparticles efficiently and specifically bound and internalized to folate receptor (FR)-bearing cancer cells in vitro. It also specifically and dose-dependently targeted to FR(+) xenograft tumor in mice with minimal accumulation in normal tissues. This first comprehensive pharmacological study suggests that the pRNA nanoparticle had all the preferred pharmacological features to serve as an efficient nanodelivery platform for broad medical applications.</abstract><notes>Abdelmawla, Sherine; Guo, Songchuan; Zhang, Limin; Pulukuri, Sai M; Patankar, Prithviraj; Conley, Patrick; Trebley, Joseph; Guo, Peixuan; Li, Qi-Xiang; CA151648/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB003730/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; SBIR1R43GM087081-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; Mol Ther. 2011 Jul;19(7):1312-22. doi: 10.1038/mt.2011.35.

Noscapine inhibits tumor growth in nude mice bearing human xenografts of hematopoietic, breast, lung, ovarian, brain and prostate origin. Despite its nontoxic attributes, significant elimination of the disease has not been achieved, perhaps since the bioavailability of noscapine to tumors saturates at an oral dose of 300 mg/kg body weight. To enable the selective and specific delivery of noscapine to prostate cancer cells, we have engineered a multifunctional nanoscale delivery vehicle that takes advantage of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) overexpression in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate epithelia and can be tracked by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and near-infrared (NIR) imaging. Specifically, we employed the human-type 135 amino-acid amino-terminal fragment (hATF) of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a high-affinity natural ligand for uPAR. Noscapine (Nos) was efficiently adsorbed onto the amphiphilic polymer coating of uPAR-targeted nanoparticles (NPs). Nos-loaded NPs were uniformly compact-sized, stable at physiological pH and efficiently released the drug at pH 4 to 5 within a span of 4h. Our results demonstrate that these uPAR-targeted NPs were capable of binding to the receptor and were internalized by PC-3 cells. uPAR-targeted Nos-loaded NPs enhanced intracellular noscapine accumulation as evident by the ~6-fold stronger inhibitory effect on PC-3 growth compared to free noscapine. In addition, Nos-loaded iron oxide NPs maintained their T2 MRI contrast effect upon internalization into tumor cells owing to their significant susceptibility effect in cells. Thus, our data provide compelling evidence that these optically and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-trackable uPAR-targeted NPs may offer a great potential for image-directed targeted delivery of noscapine for the management of prostate cancer.</abstract><notes>Abdalla, Mohamed O; Karna, Prasanthi; Sajja, Hari Krishna; Mao, Hui; Yates, Clayton; Turner, Timothy; Aneja, Ritu; K99 CA131489-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; K99 CA131489-02S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R00 CA131489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R00 CA131489-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Netherlands; J Control Release. 2011 Feb 10;149(3):314-22.

Iron/iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized from microemulsions of NaBH(4) and FeCl(3), followed by surface modification in which a thin hydrophobic hexamethyldisilazane layer - used to protect the iron core - replaced the CTAB coating on the particles. Phosphatidylcholine was then assembled on the nanoparticle surface. The resulting nanocomposite particles have a biocompatible surface and show good stability in both air and aqueous solution.

The hypothesis that the photothermal effect mediated by a near-infrared (NIR) laser and hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNSs) could modulate the release of anticancer agents is tested with biodegradable and biocompatible microspheres (1-15 microm) containing the antitumor drug paclitaxel (PTX) and HAuNSs (approximately 35 nm in diameter), which display surface plasmon absorbance in the NIR region. HAuNS-containing microspheres exhibit a NIR-induced thermal effect similar to that of plain HAuNSs. Rapid, repetitive PTX release from the PTX/HAuNS-containing microspheres is observed upon irradiation with NIR light (808 nm), whereas PTX release is insignificant when the NIR light is switched off. The release of PTX from the microspheres is readily controlled by the output power of the NIR laser, duration of irradiation, treatment frequency, and concentration of HAuNSs embedded inside the microspheres. In vitro, cancer cells incubated with PTX/HAuNS-loaded microspheres and irradiated with NIR light display significantly greater cytotoxic effects than cells incubated with the microspheres alone or cells irradiated with NIR light alone, owing to NIR-light-triggered drug release. Treatment of human U87 gliomas and MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor xenografts in nude mice with intratumoral injections of PTX/HAuNS-loaded microspheres followed by NIR irradiation results in significant tumor-growth delay compared to tumors treated with HAuNS-loaded microspheres (no PTX) and NIR irradiation or with PTX/HAuNS-loaded microspheres alone. The data support the feasibility of a therapeutic approach in which NIR light is used for simultaneous modulation of drug release and induction of photothermal cell killing.</abstract><notes>You, Jian; Shao, Ruping; Wei, Xin; Gupta, Sanjay; Li, Chun; R01 CA119387/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Germany; Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany; Small. 2010 May 7;6(9):1022-31.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20394071</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/smll.201000028</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>705</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">705</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, W.</author><author>Ahmed, M.</author><author>Elian, M.</author><author>Hady el, S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: R3230 mammary adenocarcinomas (n = 177) were implanted in 174 rats in this animal care committee-approved study. Tumors received (a) no treatment, (b) RF ablation, (c) paclitaxel, (d) RF ablation followed by paclitaxel (RF ablation-paclitaxel), (e) paclitaxel before RF ablation (paclitaxel-RF ablation), (f) RF ablation followed by doxorubicin (RF ablation-doxorubicin), (g) paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin without RF ablation (paclitaxel-doxorubicin), or (h) paclitaxel before RF ablation, followed by doxorubicin (paclitaxel-RF ablation-doxorubicin). Tumor coagulation area and diameter were compared at 24-96 hours after treatment. Intratumoral paclitaxel uptake with and without RF ablation were compared. Immunohistochemical staining revealed cleaved caspase-3 and 70-kDa HSP (HSP70) expression. Tumors were randomized into eight treatment arms for Kaplan-Meier analysis of defined survival end-point (3.0-cm diameter). RESULTS: Paclitaxel-RF ablation increased tumor coagulation over RF ablation or paclitaxel (mean, 14.0 mm +/- 0.9 [standard deviation], 6.7 mm +/- 0.6, 2.5 mm +/- 0.6, respectively; P &lt; .001). Paclitaxel-RF ablation-doxorubicin had similar tumor coagulation (P &lt; .05), compared with paclitaxel-RF ablation, at 24 and 96 hours. Mean intratumoral paclitaxel accumulation for paclitaxel-RF ablation (6.76 mug/g +/- 0.35) and RF ablation-paclitaxel (9.28 mug/g +/- 0.87) increased over that for paclitaxel (0.63 mug/g +/- 0.25, P &lt; .001). Paclitaxel substantially increased apoptosis and decreased HSP70 expression at coagulation margin. Mean end-point survival for paclitaxel-RF ablation-doxorubicin (56.8 days +/- 25.3) was greater, compared with that for paclitaxel-RF ablation or RF ablation-paclitaxel (17.6 days +/- 2.5), RF ablation-doxorubicin (30.3 days +/- 4.9, P &lt; .002), or paclitaxel-doxorubicin (27.9 days +/- 4.1, P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: Selecting adjuvant liposomal chemotherapies (paclitaxel, doxorubicin) to target cellular apoptosis and HSP production effectively increases RF ablation-induced tumor coagulation and end-point survival, and combined multidrug approach results in even better outcomes.

The dynamics of cell contraction are measured by releasing cells from surfaces to which they are attached with spatial and temporal control. Release of subcellular regions of cells is achieved by plating cells on an electrode array created by standard microfabrication methods. The electrodes are then biochemically functionalized with an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-terminated thiol. Application of a voltage pulse results in electrochemical desorption of the RGD-terminated thiols, triggering cell detachment. This method allows for the study of the full cascade of events from detachment to subsequent subcellular reorganization. Fabrication of the electrode arrays may take 1-2 d. Preparation for experiments, including surface functionalization and cell plating, can be completed in 10 h. A series of cell release experiments on one device may last several hours.</abstract><notes>Wildt, Bridget; Wirtz, Denis; Searson, Peter C; R21 EB008259-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R21EB008259/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; U54 CA143868-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA143868/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Nat Protoc. 2010 Jul;5(7):1273-80.

In this study, PRINT() nanoparticles were conjugated with TfR ligands for targeted drug delivery. Cylindrical poly(ethylene glycol)-based PRINT nanoparticles (diameter (d) = 200 nm, height (h) = 200 nm) labeled with transferrin receptor antibody (NP-OKT9) or human transferrin (NP-hTf) showed highly specific TfR-mediated uptake by all human tumor cell lines tested, relative to negative controls (IgG1 for OKT9 or bovine transferrin (bTf) for hTf). The targeting efficiency was dependent on particle concentration, ligand density, dosing time, and cell surface receptor expression level. Interestingly, NP-OKT9 or NP-hTf showed little cytotoxicity on all solid tumor cell lines tested but were very toxic to Ramos B-cell lymphoma, whereas free OKT9 or hTf was not toxic. There was a strong correlation between TfR ligand density on the particle surface and cell viability and particle uptake. NP-OKT9 and NP-hTf were internalized into acidic intracellular compartments but were not localized in EEA1-enriched early endosomes or lysosomes. Elevated caspase 3/7 activity indicates activation of apoptosis pathways upon particle treatment. Supplementation of iron suppressed the toxicity of NP-OKT9 but not NP-hTf, suggesting different mechanisms by which NP-hTf and NP-OKT9 exerts cytotoxicity on Ramos cells. On the basis of such an observation, the complex role of multivalency in nanoparticles is discussed. In addition, our data clearly reveal that one must be careful in making claims of &quot;lack of toxicity&quot; when a targeting molecule is used on nanoparticles and also raise concerns for unanticipated off-target effects when one is designing targeted chemotherapy nanodelivery agents.</abstract><notes>Wang, Jin; Tian, Shaomin; Petros, Robby A; Napier, Mary E; Desimone, Joseph M; P01-GM059299/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; R01-EB009565/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States; U54-CA119343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.; United States; Journal of the American Chemical Society; J Am Chem Soc. 2010 Aug 18;132(32):11306-13.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=20698697</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2923393</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/ja1043177</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>612</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">612</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, J.</author><author>Ahmad, H.</author><author>Ma, C.</author><author>Shi, Q.</author><author>Vermesh, O.</author><author>Vermesh, U.</author><author>Heath, J.</author></authors></contributors><auth-address>NanoSystems Biology Cancer Center, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA.</auth-address><titles><title>A self-powered, one-step chip for rapid, quantitative and multiplexed detection of proteins from pinpricks of whole blood</title><secondary-title>Lab Chip</secondary-title><alt-title>Lab on a chip</alt-title></titles><pages>3157-62</pages><volume>10</volume><number>22</number><edition>2010/10/07</edition><keywords><keyword>Blood Proteins/*analysis/metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA/chemistry</keyword><keyword>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/instrumentation/methods</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Image Processing, Computer-Assisted</keyword><keyword>Immunoassay/methods</keyword><keyword>Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/*instrumentation/methods</keyword><keyword>Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis</keyword><keyword>Point-of-Care Systems</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Spectrometry, Fluorescence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>Nov 21</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1473-0197 (Print); 1473-0189 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>20924527</accession-num><abstract>We describe an automated, self-powered chip based on lateral flow immunoassay for rapid, quantitative, and multiplex protein detection from pinpricks of whole blood.

PTEN loss has been associated with resistance to inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but the molecular basis of this resistance is unclear. It is believed that unopposed phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) activation through multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can relieve PTEN-deficient cancers from their &quot;dependence&quot; on EGFR or any other single RTK for survival. Here we report a distinct resistance mechanism whereby PTEN inactivation specifically raises EGFR activity by impairing the ligand-induced ubiquitylation and degradation of the activated receptor through destabilization of newly formed ubiquitin ligase Cbl complexes. PTEN-associated resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors is phenocopied by expression of dominant negative Cbl and can be overcome by more complete EGFR kinase inhibition. PTEN inactivation does not confer resistance to inhibitors of the MET or PDGFRA kinase. Our study identifies a critical role for PTEN in EGFR signal termination and suggests that more potent EGFR inhibition should overcome resistance caused by PI3K pathway activation.</abstract><notes>Vivanco, Igor; Rohle, Daniel; Versele, Matthias; Iwanami, Akio; Kuga, Daisuke; Oldrini, Barbara; Tanaka, Kazuhiro; Dang, Julie; Kubek, Sara; Palaskas, Nicolaos; Hsueh, Teli; Evans, Michael; Mulholland, David; Wolle, Daniel; Rajasekaran, Sigrid; Rajasekaran, Ayyappan; Liau, Linda M; Cloughesy, Timothy F; Dikic, Ivan; Brennan, Cameron; Wu, Hong; Mischel, Paul S; Perera, Timothy; Mellinghoff, Ingo K; U54CA143798-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Apr 6;107(14):6459-64.

This study describes a novel mechanism to overcome MDR through a polymer-blend nanoparticle platform that delivers a combination therapy of C6-ceramide (CER), a synthetic analog of an endogenously occurring apoptotic modulator, together with the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX), in a single formulation. The PTX/CER combination therapy circumvents another cellular mechanism whereby MDR develops, by lowering the threshold for apoptotic signaling. In vivo studies in a resistant subcutaneous SKOV3 human ovarian and in an orthotopic MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma xenograft showed that the PTX and CER nanoparticle combination therapy reduced the final tumor volume at least twofold over treatment with the standard PTX therapy alone. The study also revealed that the cotherapy accomplished this enhanced efficacy by generating an enhancement in apoptotic signaling in both tumor types. Additionally, acute evaluation of safety with the combination therapy did not show significant changes in body weight, white blood cell counts, or liver enzyme levels. The temporal-controlled nanoparticle delivery system presented in this study allows for a simultaneous delivery of PTX + CER in breast and ovarian tumor model drug, leading to a modulation of the apoptotic threshold. This strategy has tremendous potential for effective treatment of refractory disease in cancer patients.</abstract><notes>van Vlerken, Lilian E; Duan, Zhenfeng; Little, Steven R; Seiden, Michael V; Amiji, Mansoor M; R01-CA119617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; AAPS J. 2010 Jun;12(2):171-80.

To further enhance efficacy and decrease toxicity, we conjugated HB22.7, an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody to PLD, thus creating CD22-targeted immunoliposomal PLD (IL-PLD). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro cytotoxicity of IL-PLD and PLD was assessed in CD22-positive and CD22-negative cell lines. Biodistribution, myelotoxicity, and plasma pharmacokinetics were measured in NHL xenograft-bearing mice treated with IL-PLD or PLD. Survival, tumor volume, and toxicity (WBC counts, body weights) were assessed in mice receiving a single dose (8, 12, or 16 mg DXR/kg) or three doses (8 mg DXR/kg/dose) of IL-PLD; controls were PLD, free DXR, PLD plus unconjugated HB22.7, IL-null (HB22.7-conjugated empty liposome), and nontreated mice. RESULTS: IL-PLD improved cytotoxicity over PLD only in CD22-positive cells. IL-PLD displayed similar pharmacokinetics and toxicities as PLD. Tumor DXR accumulation was greater and tumor/normal tissue ratios were similar (spleen) or greater (kidney, lung, and liver) in mice treated with IL-PLD versus PLD. IL-PLD reduced tumor volume more effectively than PLD at all doses; the three-dose regimen was superior. The three-dose regimen was used in confirmatory studies, which showed that IL-PLD produced significantly greater tumor volume reduction and enhanced survival versus PLD.

The developed system has an embedded array of PEG microwells fabricated on a planar indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. Due to its dielectric properties, the PEG microwells define electrical energy landscapes, effectively forming positive dielectrophoresis (DEP) traps in a low-conductivity environment. Distribution of DEP forces on a model cell was first estimated by computationally solving quasi-electrostatic Maxwell&apos;s equations, followed by an experimental demonstration of cell and particle patterning without an external flow. Furthermore, efficient patterning of mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells was successfully achieved in combination with an external flow. With a seeding density of 10(7) cells/mL and a flow rate of 3 muL/min, trapping of cells in the microwells was completed in tens of seconds after initiation of the DEP operation. Captured cells subsequently formed viable and homogeneous monolayer patterns. This simple approach could provide an efficient strategy for fabricating various cell microarrays for applications such as cell-based biosensors, drug discovery, and cell microenvironment studies.</abstract><notes>Tsutsui, Hideaki; Yu, Edmond; Marquina, Sabrina; Valamehr, Bahram; Wong, Ieong; Wu, Hong; Ho, Chih-Ming; 1PN2 EY018228/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; Ann Biomed Eng. 2010 Dec;38(12):3777-88.

In contrast to its well established therapeutic relevance, the biological function of dCK remains enigmatic. Highest levels of dCK expression are found in thymus and bone marrow, indicating a possible role in lymphopoiesis. To test this hypothesis we generated and analyzed dCK knockout (KO) mice. dCK inactivation selectively and profoundly affected T and B cell development. A 90-fold decrease in thymic cellularity was observed in the dCK KO mice relative to wild-type littermates. Lymphocyte numbers in the dCK KO mice were 5- to 13-fold below normal values. The severe impact of dCK inactivation on lymphopoiesis was unexpected given that nucleoside salvage has been thought to play a limited, &quot;fine-tuning&quot; role in regulating deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate pools produced by the de novo pathway. The dCK KO phenotype challenges this view and indicates that, in contrast to the great majority of other somatic cells, normal lymphocyte development critically requires the deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway.</abstract><notes>Toy, Gerald; Austin, Wayne R; Liao, Hsiang-I; Cheng, Donghui; Singh, Arun; Campbell, Dean O; Ishikawa, Tomo-o; Lehmann, Lynn W; Satyamurthy, Nagichettiar; Phelps, Michael E; Herschman, Harvey R; Czernin, Johannes; Witte, Owen N; Radu, Caius G; 5U54 CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA86306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R24 CA92865/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA09297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Howard Hughes Medical Institute/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Mar 23;107(12):5551-6.

The multivalent conjugation of targeting ligands on the surface of nanoparticles is presumed to enhance binding to the desired target. However, given the complexities inherent in the interactions of nanoparticle surfaces with proteins, and the structural diversity of nanoparticle scaffolds and targeting ligands, our understanding of how conjugation of targeting ligands affects nanoparticle binding remains incomplete. Here, we use surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to directly and quantitatively study the affinity and binding kinetics of nanoparticles that display small molecules conjugated to their surface. We studied the interaction between a single protein target and a structurally related series of targeting ligands whose intrinsic affinity varies over a 4500-fold range and performed SPR at protein densities that reflect endogenous receptor densities. We report that even weak small molecule targeting ligands can significantly enhance target-specific avidity (by up to 4 orders of magnitude) through multivalent interactions and also observe a much broader range of kinetic effects than has been previously reported. Quantitative measurement of how the affinity and kinetics of nanoparticle binding vary as a function of different surface conjugations is a rapid, generalizable approach to nanoparticle characterization that can inform the design of nanoparticles for biomedical applications.</abstract><notes>Tassa, Carlos; Duffner, Jay L; Lewis, Timothy A; Weissleder, Ralph; Schreiber, Stuart L; Koehler, Angela N; Shaw, Stanley Y; CA119349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; HL077186/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; HL80731/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; K08 HL077186-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; U01 HL080731-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119349-050003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Bioconjug Chem. 2010 Jan;21(1):14-9.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20028085</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2902264</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/bc900438a</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>303</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">303</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tanaka, T.</author><author>Mangala, L.

Here, we report on a novel approach to overcome these limitations using a multistage vector composed of mesoporous silicon particles (stage 1 microparticles, S1MP) loaded with neutral nanoliposomes (dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, DOPC) containing small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted against the EphA2 oncoprotein, which is overexpressed in most cancers, including ovarian. Our delivery methods resulted in sustained EphA2 gene silencing for at least 3 weeks in two independent orthotopic mouse models of ovarian cancer following a single i.v. administration of S1MP loaded with EphA2-siRNA-DOPC. Furthermore, a single administration of S1MP loaded with-EphA2-siRNA-DOPC substantially reduced tumor burden, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation compared with a noncoding control siRNA alone (SKOV3ip1, 54%; HeyA8, 57%), with no significant changes in serum chemistries or in proinflammatory cytokines. In summary, we have provided the first in vivo therapeutic validation of a novel, multistage siRNA delivery system for sustained gene silencing with broad applicability to pathologies beyond ovarian neoplasms.</abstract><notes>Tanaka, Takemi; Mangala, Lingegowda S; Vivas-Mejia, Pablo E; Nieves-Alicea, Rene; Mann, Aman P; Mora, Edna; Han, Hee-Dong; Shahzad, Mian M K; Liu, Xuewu; Bhavane, Rohan; Gu, Jianhua; Fakhoury, Jean R; Chiappini, Ciro; Lu, Chunhua; Matsuo, Koji; Godin, Biana; Stone, Rebecca L; Nick, Alpa M; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K; Ferrari, Mauro; CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; HD050128/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA109298-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA110793-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128797-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R33 CA122864-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R33CA122864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Res. 2010 May 1;70(9):3687-96.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20430760</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3202607</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3931</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>301</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">301</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tanaka, T.</author><author>Godin, B.</author><author>Bhavane, R.</author><author>Nieves-Alicea, R.</author><author>Gu, J.</author><author>Liu, X.</author><author>Chiappini, C.</author><author>Fakhoury, J.

We have recently introduced multistage nanoporous silicon microparticles (S1MP) designed as a cargo for nanocarrier drug delivery to enable the loaded therapeutics and diagnostics to sequentially overcome the biological barriers in order to reach their target. In this first report on biocompatibility of intravenously administered pSi structures, we examined the tolerability of negatively (-32.5+/-3.1mV) and positively (8.7+/-2.5mV) charged S1MP in acute single dose (10(7), 10(8), 5x10(8) S1MP/animal) and subchronic multiple dose (10(8) S1MP/animal/week for 4 weeks) administration schedules. Our data demonstrate that S1MP did not change plasma levels of renal (BUN and creatinine) and hepatic (LDH) biomarkers as well as 23 plasma cytokines. LDH plasma levels of 145.2+/-23.6, 115.4+/-29.1 vs. 127.0+/-10.4; and 155.8+/-38.4, 135.5+/-52.3 vs. 178.4+/-74.6 were detected in mice treated with 10(8) negatively charged S1MP, 10(8) positively charged S1MP vs. saline control in single and multiple dose schedules, respectively. The S1MPs did not alter LDH levels in liver and spleen, nor lead to infiltration of leukocytes into the liver, spleen, kidney, lung, brain, heart, and thyroid.

However, for patients who progress after chemotherapy, its effectiveness diminishes due to the emergence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) after prolonged therapy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to overcome both the dose-limiting side effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents and the therapeutic failure resulting from MDR, we designed and evaluated a novel drug delivery system for MDR1 siRNA delivery. Novel biocompatible, lipid-modified dextran-based polymeric nanoparticles were used as the platform for MDR1 siRNA delivery; and the efficacy of combination therapy with this system was evaluated. In this study, multi-drug resistant osteosarcoma cell lines (KHOS(R2) and U-2OS(R2)) were treated with the MDR1 siRNA nanocarriers and MDR1 protein (P-gp) expression, drug retention, and immunofluoresence were analyzed. Combination therapy of the MDR1 siRNA loaded nanocarriers with increasing concentrations of doxorubicin was also analyzed. We observed that MDR1 siRNA loaded dextran nanoparticles efficiently suppresses P-gp expression in the drug resistant osteosarcoma cell lines. The results also demonstrated that this approach may be capable of reversing drug resistance by increasing the amount of drug accumulation in MDR cell lines. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Lipid-modified dextran-based polymeric nanoparticles are a promising platform for siRNA delivery.

Current technologies for quantitation of the cancer proteome are either qualitative (e.g., immunohistochemistry) or require large sample sizes (e.g., flow cytometry). Here, we report a microfluidic platform-microfluidic image cytometry (MIC)-capable of quantitative, single-cell proteomic analysis of multiple signaling molecules using only 1,000 to 2,800 cells. Using cultured cell lines, we show simultaneous measurement of four critical signaling proteins (EGFR, PTEN, phospho-Akt, and phospho-S6) within the oncogenic phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. To show the clinical application of the MIC platform to solid tumors, we analyzed a panel of 19 human brain tumor biopsies, including glioblastomas. Our MIC measurements were validated by clinical immunohistochemistry and confirmed the striking intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity characteristic of glioblastoma. To interpret the multiparameter, single-cell MIC measurements, we adapted bioinformatic methods including self-organizing maps that stratify patients into clusters that predict tumor progression and patient survival. Together with bioinformatic analysis, the MIC platform represents a robust, enabling in vitro molecular diagnostic technology for systems pathology analysis and personalized medicine.</abstract><notes>Sun, Jing; Masterman-Smith, Michael D; Graham, Nicholas A; Jiao, Jing; Mottahedeh, Jack; Laks, Dan R; Ohashi, Minori; DeJesus, Jason; Kamei, Ken-ichiro; Lee, Ki-Bum; Wang, Hao; Yu, Zeta T F; Lu, Yi-Tsung; Hou, Shuang; Li, Keyu; Liu, Max; Zhang, Nangang; Wang, Shutao; Angenieux, Brigitte; Panosyan, Eduard; Samuels, Eric R; Park, Jun; Williams, Dirk; Konkankit, Vera; Nathanson, David; van Dam, R Michael; Phelps, Michael E; Wu, Hong; Liau, Linda M; Mischel, Paul S; Lazareff, Jorge A; Kornblum, Harley I; Yong, William H; Graeber, Thomas G; Tseng, Hsian-Rong; DP2 OD006462-01/OD/NIH HHS/; NS052563/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; R01 NS052563-01A1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; T32 CA009056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA009056-35/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119347-040006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Res. 2010 Aug 1;70(15):6128-38.

Bcl2L12 (for Bcl2-like 12) is a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein that is overexpressed in primary GBM and functions to inhibit post-mitochondrial apoptosis signaling. Here, we show that nuclear Bcl2L12 physically and functionally interacts with the p53 tumor suppressor, as evidenced by the capacity of Bcl2L12 to (1) enable bypass of replicative senescence without concomitant loss of p53 or p19 (Arf), (2) inhibit p53-dependent DNA damage-induced apoptosis, (3) impede the capacity of p53 to bind some of its target gene promoters, and (4) attenuate endogenous p53-directed transcriptomic changes following genotoxic stress. Correspondingly, The Cancer Genome Atlas profile and tissue protein analyses of human GBM specimens show significantly lower Bcl2L12 expression in the setting of genetic p53 pathway inactivation. Thus, Bcl2L12 is a multifunctional protein that contributes to intense therapeutic resistance of GBM through its ability to operate on two key nodes of cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling cascades.</abstract><notes>Stegh, Alexander H; Brennan, Cameron; Mahoney, John A; Forloney, Kristin L; Jenq, Harry T; Luciano, Janina P; Protopopov, Alexei; Chin, Lynda; Depinho, Ronald A; 5P01CA95616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; 5R00CA129172-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R00 CA129172-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA99041/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U24 CA126543-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Genes Dev. 2010 Oct 1;24(19):2194-204.

CD44-hyaluronic acid interactions can be exploited for targeted delivery of anticancer agents specifically to cancer cells. Although various splicing variants of CD44 are expressed on the plasma membrane of cancer cells, the hyaluronic acid binding domain (HABD) is highly conserved among the CD44 splicing variants. Using a novel two-step process, we have identified monothiophosphate-modified aptamers (thioaptamers) that specifically bind to the CD44&apos;s HABD with high affinities. Binding affinities of the selected thioaptamers for the HABD were in the range of 180-295 nM, an affinity significantly higher than that of hyaluronic acid (K(d) above the micromolar range). The selected thioaptamers bound to CD44 positive human ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3, IGROV, and A2780) but failed to bind the CD44 negative NIH3T3 cell line. Our results indicated that thio substitution at specific positions of the DNA phosphate backbone results in specific and high-affinity binding of thioaptamers to CD44. The selected thioaptamers will be of great interest for further development as a targeting or imaging agent for the delivery of therapeutic payloads for cancer tissues.</abstract><notes>Somasunderam, Anoma; Thiviyanathan, Varatharasa; Tanaka, Takemi; Li, Xin; Neerathilingam, Muniasamy; Lokesh, Ganesh Lakshmana Rao; Mann, Aman; Peng, Yang; Ferrari, Mauro; Klostergaard, Jim; Gorenstein, David G; 2U54CA096300-06A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CC987654321/CC/CDC HHS/; GM084552/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; N01-HV28184/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/; P41 RR002250-237288/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; R01 CA128797-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128797-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128797-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128797-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2 GM092599-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; RC2 GM092599-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Biochemistry. 2010 Oct 26;49(42):9106-12.</notes><work-type>In Vitro; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20843027</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2981344</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/bi1009503</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1234</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1234</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, B.

Our recent findings suggest that chronic stress is associated with increased IL8 levels. Here, we examined the molecular and biological significance of IL8 in stress-induced tumor growth. Norepinephrine (NE) treatment of ovarian cancer cells resulted in a 250-300% increase in IL8 protein and 240-320% increase in its mRNA levels. Epinephrine treatment resulted in similar increases. Moreover, NE treatment resulted in a 3.5-4-fold increase in IL8 promoter activity. These effects were blocked by propranolol. Promoter deletion analyses suggested that AP1 transcription factors might mediate catecholamine-stimulated up-regulation of IL8. siRNA inhibition studies identified FosB as the pivotal component responsible for IL8 regulation by NE. In vivo chronic stress resulted in increased tumor growth (by 221 and 235%; p &lt; 0.01) in orthotopic xenograft models involving SKOV3ip1 and HeyA8 ovarian carcinoma cells. This enhanced tumor growth was completely blocked by IL8 or FosB gene silencing using 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine nanoliposomes. IL8 and FosB silencing reduced microvessel density (based on CD31 staining) by 2.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Our findings indicate that neurobehavioral stress leads to FosB-driven increases in IL8, which is associated with increased tumor growth and metastases. These findings may have implications for ovarian cancer management.</abstract><notes>Shahzad, Mian M K; Arevalo, Jesusa M; Armaiz-Pena, Guillermo N; Lu, Chunhua; Stone, Rebecca L; Moreno-Smith, Myrthala; Nishimura, Masato; Lee, Jeong-Won; Jennings, Nicholas B; Bottsford-Miller, Justin; Vivas-Mejia, Pablo; Lutgendorf, Susan K; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Bar-Eli, Menashe; Cole, Steven W; Sood, Anil K; CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; HD050128/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/; RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; T32 CA009614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA101642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Biol Chem. 2010 Nov 12;285(46):35462-70.

Although many key proteins and pathways involved in ovarian carcinogenesis and metastasis have been discovered, knowledge of the early steps leading to malignancy remains poorly understood. This poor understanding stems from lack of data from early-stage cancers and absence of a well-established premalignant state universal to all ovarian cancer subtypes. Existing evidence suggests that ovarian cancers develop either through a stepwise mutation process (low-grade pathway), through genetic instability resulting in hastened metastasis (high-grade pathway), or more recently through what has been described as the &quot;&apos;fimbrial-ovarian&apos; serous neoplasia theory.&quot; In this latter model, ovarian serous cancers evolve from premalignant lesions in the distal fallopian tube called tubal intraepithelial carcinoma. In this manuscript, we review key genetic and molecular changes that occur in cancer cell progression and suggest a model of ovarian cancer pathogenesis involving both tumor cell mutations and microenvironmental factors.</abstract><notes>Saad, Antonio F; Hu, Wei; Sood, Anil K; CA 109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA 110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA098258-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA109298-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA110793-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA128797-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2 GM092599-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Horm Cancer. 2010 Dec;1(6):277-90.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.; Review</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21761359</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3199131</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12672-010-0054-2</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>749</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">749</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ruoslahti, E.</author><author>Bhatia, S.

These differentially expressed molecules can be used as docking sites to concentrate drug conjugates and nanoparticles at tumors. Specific markers in tumor vessels are particularly well suited for targeting because molecules at the surface of blood vessels are readily accessible to circulating compounds. The increased concentration of a drug in the site of disease made possible by targeted delivery can be used to increase efficacy, reduce side effects, or achieve some of both.

Harmonic amplitudes have been used to produce quantitative images and ratios of these amplitudes have been used to monitor changes in the particle environment. Harmonic phase angles have not yet been utilized in these pursuits. The authors explore harmonic phase angle as a concentration-independent means of remotely monitoring the dynamic magnetization of nanoparticles. METHODS: A magnetic nanoparticle spectrometer was used to explore the impacts of viscosity and excitation frequency and amplitude on the phase angle of magnetization harmonics. A dynamic model, which accounts for particle relaxation times, was used to model some results. RESULTS: Harmonic phase angle can undergo large changes when a nanoparticle&apos;s Brownian motion is altered. Excitation parameters and particle characteristics have a profound effect on the extent of these changes. CONCLUSIONS: Phase angle can allow for monitoring of various impacts on a nanoparticle&apos;s Brownian motion. When combined with other concentration-independent metrics, such as ratios of harmonic amplitudes, valuable information about the particle&apos;s environment can be gathered.</abstract><notes>Rauwerdink, Adam M; Weaver, John B; Med Phys. 2010 Jun;37(6):2587-92.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20632570</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3138797</custom2><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>517</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">517</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rauwerdink, A.

The use of light as a remote-activation mechanism for drug delivery has received increased attention due to its advantages in highly specific spatial and temporal control of compound release. Photo-triggered theranostic constructs could facilitate an entirely new category of clinical solutions which permit early recognition of the disease by enhancing contrast in various imaging modalities followed by the tailored guidance of therapy. Finally, such theranostic agents could aid imaging modalities in monitoring response to therapy.

Although the Ki-67 protein (pKi-67) is a key marker associated with aggressively proliferating cancer cells and poor prognosis, its full potential as a therapeutic target has never before been successfully shown. In this regard, its nuclear localization presents a major hurdle because of the need for intracellular and intranuclear delivery of targeting and therapeutic moieties. Using a liposomally encapsulated construct, we show for the first time the specific delivery of a Ki-67-directed antibody and subsequent light-triggered death in the human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-5. Photoimmunoconjugate-encapsulating liposomes (PICEL) were constructed from anti-pKi-67 antibodies conjugated to fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate, as a photoactivatable agent, followed by encapsulation in noncationic liposomes. Nucleolar localization of the PICELs was confirmed by confocal imaging. Photodynamic activation with PICELs specifically killed pKi-67-positive cancer cells both in monolayer and in three-dimensional (3D) cultures of OVCAR-5 cells, with the antibody TuBB-9 targeting a physiologically active form of pKi-67 but not with MIB-1, directed to a different epitope. This is the first demonstration of (a) the exploitation of Ki-67 as a molecular target for therapy and (b) specific delivery of an antibody to the nucleolus in monolayer cancer cells and in an in vitro 3D model system. In view of the ubiquity of pKi-67 in proliferating cells in cancer and the specificity of targeting in 3D multicellular acini, these findings are promising and the approach merits further investigation.</abstract><notes>Rahmanzadeh, Ramtin; Rai, Prakash; Celli, Jonathan P; Rizvi, Imran; Baron-Luhr, Bettina; Gerdes, Johannes; Hasan, Tayyaba; 5R01 CA119388-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA119388-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA119388-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC1 CA146337-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC1CA146337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Res. 2010 Nov 15;70(22):9234-42.

After decades of sporadic successes scattered amongst frequent failures, the field of tumor immunology is now poised to take advantage of a greatly improved understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of immune tolerance. Further enhancing the prospects of cancer immunotherapy are technological advantages that have resulted in sophisticated diagnostic and immune monitoring approaches. Amongst these approaches, molecular imaging has the potential to play a transformational role in the development of highly efficient immune therapies. This brief review outlines recent significant steps in this direction, and discusses strategies to incorporate molecular imaging in the design of the next generation of experimental and clinical cell-based immune interventions against cancer.</abstract><notes>Rabinovich, Brian A; Radu, Caius G; 5U54 CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Netherlands; Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2010 Sep 1;11(6):672-84.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Review</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20497110</url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>748</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">748</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Poon, Z.</author><author>Chen, S. </author><author>Engler, A.

Current techniques to compare expression profiles typically involve choosing a fixed differential expression threshold to summarize results, potentially reducing sensitivity to small but concordant changes. We present a threshold-free algorithm called Rank-rank Hypergeometric Overlap (RRHO). This algorithm steps through two gene lists ranked by the degree of differential expression observed in two profiling experiments, successively measuring the statistical significance of the number of overlapping genes. The output is a graphical map that shows the strength, pattern and bounds of correlation between two expression profiles. To demonstrate RRHO sensitivity and dynamic range, we identified shared expression networks in cancer microarray profiles driving tumor progression, stem cell properties and response to targeted kinase inhibition. We demonstrate how RRHO can be used to determine which model system or drug treatment best reflects a particular biological or disease response. The threshold-free and graphical aspects of RRHO complement other rank-based approaches such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), for which RRHO is a 2D analog. Rank-rank overlap analysis is a sensitive, robust and web-accessible method for detecting and visualizing overlap trends between two complete, continuous gene-expression profiles. A web-based implementation of RRHO can be accessed at http://systems.crump.ucla.edu/rankrank/.</abstract><notes>Plaisier, Seema B; Taschereau, Richard; Wong, Justin A; Graeber, Thomas G; T32 CA09056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 GM008652/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; England; Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Sep;38(17):e169.

Nevertheless, advances in nanoparticle engineering, as well as advances in understanding the importance of nanoparticle characteristics such as size, shape and surface properties for biological interactions, are creating new opportunities for the development of nanoparticles for therapeutic applications.

Previous studies have shown that the dense monolayer of oligonucleotides on the nanoparticle leads to the adsorption of serum proteins and facilitates cellular uptake. Here, we show that serum proteins generally act to inhibit cellular uptake of DNA-Au NPs. We identify the pathway for DNA-Au NP entry in HeLa cells. Biochemical analyses indicate that DNA-Au NPs are taken up by a process involving receptor-mediated endocytosis. Evidence shows that DNA-Au NP entry is primarily mediated by scavenger receptors, a class of pattern-recognition receptors. This uptake mechanism appears to be conserved across species, as blocking the same receptors in mouse cells also disrupted DNA-Au NP entry. Polyvalent nanoparticles functionalized with siRNA are shown to enter through the same pathway. Thus, scavenger receptors are required for cellular uptake of polyvalent oligonucleotide functionalized nanoparticles.</abstract><notes>Journal article; Bioconjugate chemistry; Bioconjug Chem. 2010 Nov 11.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21070003</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/bc1002423</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>39</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">39</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parrott, M.

A limited number of biomaterials provide precise control over the rate of degradation and the release rate of entrapped cargo and yield a material that is intrinsically nontoxic. In this work, we designed nontoxic acid-sensitive biomaterials based on silyl ether chemistry. A host of silyl ether cross-linkers were synthesized and molded into relevant medical devices, including Trojan horse particles, sutures, and stents. The resulting devices were engineered to degrade under acidic conditions known to exist in tumor tissue, inflammatory tissue, and diseased cells. The implementation of silyl ether chemistry gave precise control over the rate of degradation and afforded devices that could degrade over the course of hours, days, weeks, or months, depending upon the steric bulk around the silicon atom. These novel materials could be useful for numerous biomedical applications, including drug delivery, tissue repair, and general surgery.</abstract><notes>Parrott, Matthew C; Luft, J Chris; Byrne, James D; Fain, John H; Napier, Mary E; Desimone, Joseph M; 1DP10D006432-01/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States; 1R01EB009565-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States; U54CA119373/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; United States; Journal of the American Chemical Society; J Am Chem Soc. 2010 Dec 22;132(50):17928-32.

Pegylated-liposomal doxorubicin (PLD, Ben Venue Laboratories, Inc), a produces less myelotoxicity than non-liposomal (NL) doxorubicin. To further enhance efficacy and NHL targeting and to decrease toxicity, we conjugated an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody (HB22.7) to the surface of PLD, thereby creating CD22-targeted immunoliposomal PLD (IL-PLD). HB22.7 was successfully conjugated to PLD and the resulting IL-PLD exhibits specific binding to CD22-expressing cells as assessed by immunofluorescence staining. IL-PLD exhibits more cytotoxicity than PLD in CD22 positive cell lines but does not increase killing of CD22 negative cells. The IC(50) of IL-PLD is 3.1 to 5.4 times lower than that of PLD in CD22+ cell lines while the IC(50) of IL-PLD is equal to that of PLD in CD22- cells.

PET, utilizing probes for specific metabolic processes, detects regions of immune activation in vivo. In this study we investigated the immune cell specificity of PET probes for two different metabolic pathways: [18F]-2-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) for glycolysis and [18F]-2-fluoro-D-(arabinofuranosyl)cytosine ([18F]-FAC) for deoxycytidine salvage. We isolated innate and adaptive immune cells from tissues of mice challenged with a retrovirus-induced sarcoma and measured their ability to accumulate FDG and FAC. We determined that the two probes had distinct patterns of accumulation: FDG accumulated to the highest levels in innate immune cells, while FAC accumulated predominantly in CD8+ T cells in a manner that correlated with cellular proliferation. This study demonstrates that innate and adaptive cell types differ in glycolytic and deoxycytidine salvage demands during an immune response and that these differential metabolic requirements can be detected with specific PET probes. Our findings have implications for the interpretation of clinical PET scans that use [18F]-FDG or [18F]-FAC to assess immune function in vivo and suggest potential applications of metabolic PET to monitor the effects of targeted immune modulation.</abstract><notes>Nair-Gill, Evan; Wiltzius, Stephanie M; Wei, Xiao X; Cheng, Donghui; Riedinger, Mireille; Radu, Caius G; Witte, Owen N; 5U54 CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA86306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 A1065067/PHS HHS/; T32 GM08042/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; Howard Hughes Medical Institute/; J Clin Invest. 2010 Jun;120(6):2005-15. doi: 10.1172/JCI41250.

Using biocompatible nanoparticles as a generic platform (containing a (18)F isotope and a far red fluorochrome), we show good correlations between FMT and PET in probe concentration (r(2) &gt; 0.99) and spatial signal distribution (r(2) &gt; 0.85). Using a mouse model of cancer and different imaging probes to measure tumoral proteases, macrophage content and integrin expression simultaneously, we demonstrate the distinct tumoral locations of probes in multiple channels in vivo.

Here we report the use of a hand-held spectroscopic pen device (termed SpectroPen) and near-infrared contrast agents for intraoperative detection of malignant tumors, based on wavelength-resolved measurements of fluorescence and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signals. The SpectroPen utilizes a near-infrared diode laser (emitting at 785 nm) coupled to a compact head unit for light excitation and collection. This pen-shaped device effectively removes silica Raman peaks from the fiber optics and attenuates the reflected excitation light, allowing sensitive analysis of both fluorescence and Raman signals. Its overall performance has been evaluated by using a fluorescent contrast agent (indocyanine green, or ICG) as well as a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) contrast agent (pegylated colloidal gold). Under in vitro conditions, the detection limits are approximately 2-5 x 10(-11) M for the indocyanine dye and 0.5-1 x 10(-13) M for the SERS contrast agent. Ex vivo tissue penetration data show attenuated but resolvable fluorescence and Raman signals when the contrast agents are buried 5-10 mm deep in fresh animal tissues. In vivo studies using mice bearing bioluminescent 4T1 breast tumors further demonstrate that the tumor borders can be precisely detected preoperatively and intraoperatively, and that the contrast signals are strongly correlated with tumor bioluminescence. After surgery, the SpectroPen device permits further evaluation of both positive and negative tumor margins around the surgical cavity, raising new possibilities for real-time tumor detection and image-guided surgery.</abstract><notes>K99 CA153916-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; K99 CA153916-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2 CA148265-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119338-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119338-05S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Anal Chem. 2010 Oct 6.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20925393</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3030682</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/ac102058k</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>771</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">771</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCarthy, J.

These particles are modified with near-infrared fluorophores and light-activated therapeutic moieties, which allow for the optical determination of agent localization and phototoxic activation at spectrally distinct wavelengths. The resulting agent is readily taken up by murine macrophages in vitro and is highly phototoxic, with an LD(50) of 430 pM. Intravenous administration results in the localization of the nanoagent within macrophage-rich atherosclerotic lesions that can be imaged by intravital fluorescence microscopy. Irradiation of the atheroma with 650 nm light activates the therapeutic component and results in eradication of inflammatory macrophages, which may induce lesion stabilization. Importantly, these agents display limited skin photosensitivity, are highly efficacious, and provide an integrated imaging and therapeutic nanoplatform for atherosclerosis.</abstract><notes>McCarthy, Jason R; Korngold, Ethan; Weissleder, Ralph; Jaffer, Farouc A; R21 HL093607-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R21HL093607/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; U01-HL080731/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; Howard Hughes Medical Institute/; Germany; Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany; Small. 2010 Sep 20;6(18):2041-9.</notes><work-type>Evaluation Studies; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20721949</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3018665</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/smll.201000596</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>259</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">259</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCabe, K.

As a result of the significant role that these immunotherapeutics play in the management of cancer, and the potential utility of complementary imaging agents, immunoPET imaging has generated considerable interest. This update discusses the important factors to consider when designing a PET (positron emission tomography) imaging agent from the molecular target to the biological targeting molecule and radionuclide combination and also reviews recent preclinical and clinical findings in the immunoPET field. Although there are a variety of radionuclides that are currently utilized in PET studies, this update focuses on four of the positron emitters commonly used in labeling proteins: iodine-124, zirconium-89, copper-64, and fluorine-18. Notable advances in the preclinical setting include the continued development of immunoPET probes to predict the biodistribution of related radioimmunotherapeutics, the success of nontraditional radionuclide and antibody fragment combinations, the broader use of zirconium-89, and the recent emergence of (18)F-labeled diabodies for same-day imaging. Antibody-based PET probes constitute a valuable class of molecular imaging agents, and the progress made preclinically should expedite the transition of these targeted diagnostics to clinical applications.</abstract><notes>McCabe, Katelyn E; Wu, Anna M; CA 016042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; CA 086306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; CA 092131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; CA 119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; United States; Cancer biotherapy &amp; radiopharmaceuticals; Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2010 Jun;25(3):253-61.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=20578830</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>PMC2936262</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/cbr.2010.0776</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Massich, M.

Thus, evaluating the biocompatibility of these nanomaterials is imperative. Here we use genome-wide expression profiling to study the biological response of HeLa cells to gold nanoparticles functionalized with nucleic acids. Our study finds that the biological response to gold nanoparticles stabilized by weakly bound surface ligands is significant (cells recognize and react to the presence of the particles), yet when these same nanoparticles are stably functionalized with covalently attached nucleic acids, the cell shows no measurable response. This finding is important for researchers studying and using nanomaterials in biological settings, as it demonstrates how slight changes in surface chemistry and particle stability can lead to significant differences in cellular responses.</abstract><notes>Massich, Matthew D; Giljohann, David A; Schmucker, Abrin L; Patel, Pinal C; Mirkin, Chad A; 1P30AR057216/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.; United States; ACS nano; ACS Nano. 2010 Oct 26;4(10):5641-6.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20860397</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/nn102228s</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>588</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">588</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mann, A.

E-selectin expression is induced on the endothelial cell surface of vessels in response to inflammatory stimuli but is absent in the normal vessels. Thus, E-selectin is an attractive molecular target, and high affinity ligands for E-selectin could be powerful tools for the delivery of therapeutics and/or imaging agents to inflamed vessels. In this study, we identified a thiophosphate modified aptamer (thioaptamer, TA) against E-selectin (ESTA-1) by employing a two-step selection strategy: a recombinant protein-based TA binding selection from a combinatorial library followed by a cell-based TA binding selection using E-selectin expressing human microvascular endothelial cells. ESTA-1 selectively bound to E-selectin with nanomolar binding affinity (K(D) = 47 nM) while exhibiting minimal cross reactivity to P- and L-selectin. Furthermore, ESTA-1 binding to E-selectin on the endothelial cells markedly antagonized the adhesion (over 75% inhibition) of sLe(x) positive HL-60 cells at nanomolar concentration. ESTA-1 also bound specifically to the inflamed tumor-associated vasculature of human carcinomas derived from breast, ovarian, and skin but not to normal organs, and this binding was highly associated with the E-selectin expression level. Similarly, intravenously injected ESTA-1 demonstrated distinct binding to the tumor vasculature in a breast cancer xenograft model. Together, our data substantiates the discovery of a thioaptamer (ESTA-1) that binds to E-selectin with high affinity and specificity, thereby highlighting the potential application of ESTA-1 for E-selectin targeted delivery.</abstract><notes>Mann, Aman P; Somasunderam, Anoma; Nieves-Alicea, Rene; Li, Xin; Hu, Austin; Sood, Anil K; Ferrari, Mauro; Gorenstein, David G; Tanaka, Takemi; BC096250/BC/NCI NIH HHS/; N01-HV-28184/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/; U54CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; PLoS One. 2010 Sep 30;5(9). pii: e13050.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20927342</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2948018</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0013050</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>374</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">374</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mali, P.</author><author>Wirtz, D. </author><author>Searson, P.

Hence, mechanisms that prevent mitotic detachment and ensure appropriate positioning of the resulting daughter cells are critical for effective tissue morphogenesis and repair, and are the subject of this study. We find that, unlike low-motility cells, highly motile cells spread isotropically upon division and do not typically reoccupy their mother-cell footprint, and often even disseminate their mitotic cells. To elucidate these different motility-based phenotypes, we investigated their partial recapitulation and rescue using defined molecular perturbations. We show that activated RhoA is localized at the mitotic cell cortex, and Rho-associated kinase inhibition increases the degree of reoccupation of the mother-cell outline in highly motile cells. Conversely, we show that induction of motility in low-motility cells by RasV12 overexpression results in increased isotropic daughter-cell spreading. We thus propose that a balance between cortical retraction forces, which depend in part on RhoA activation, and substrate adhesion forces, which diminish with increasing motility rates, governs the integrity of mitotic actin retraction fibers and influences subsequent daughter-cell spreading. This balance of forces during mitosis has implications for cancer metastasis.</abstract><notes>Mali, Prashant; Wirtz, Denis; Searson, Peter C; CA143868/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB008259/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; GM084204/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R21 EB008259-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Biophys J. 2010 Dec 1;99(11):3526-34.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21112276</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2998611</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bpj.2010.10.006</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>257</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">257</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mak, A.

While highly specific and sensitive, traditional immunochemical assays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) often require expensive read-out equipment (e.g. fluorescent labels) and lack the capability of multiplex detection. By combining the superior specificity of immunoassays with the sensitivity and simplicity of magnetic detection, we have developed a novel multiplex magnetic nanotag-based detection platform for mycotoxins that functions on a sub-picomolar concentration level. Unlike fluorescent labels, magnetic nanotags (MNTs) can be detected with inexpensive giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors such as spin-valve sensors. In the system presented here, each spin-valve sensor has an active area of 90 [mu]m × 90 [mu]m, arranged in an 8 × 8 array. Sample is added to the antibody-immobilized sensor array prior to the addition of the biotinylated detection antibody. The sensor response is recorded in real time upon the addition of streptavidin-linked MNTs on the chip. Here we demonstrate the simultaneous detection of multiple mycotoxins (aflatoxins B1, zearalenone and HT-2) and show that a detection limit of 50 pg/mL can be achieved.</abstract><notes>doi: DOI: 10.1016/j.bios.2009.11.028</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6TFC-4XVRYKD-1/2/b2b5937649746c94ef4a700f61c2cb16</url></related-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>827</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">827</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luxenhofer, R.</author><author>Schulz, A.</author><author>Roques, C.</author><author>Li, S.</author><author>Bronich, T.

Well-defined amphiphilic di- and triblock copolymers based on poly(2-oxazolines) were prepared and used for the solubilization of Paclitaxel (PTX) and other water-insoluble drugs. Probing the polymer micelles in water with the fluorescence probe pyrene, an unusual high polar microenvironment of the probe was observed. This coincides with an extraordinary large loading capacity for PTX of 45 wt.% active drug in the formulation as well as high water solubility of the resulting formulation. Physicochemical properties of the formulations, ease of preparation and stability upon lyophilization, low toxicity and immunogenicity suggest that poly(2-oxazoline)s are promising candidates for the delivery of highly challenging drugs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PTX is fully active and provides superior tumor inhibition as compared to the commercial micellar formulation.</abstract><notes>Luxenhofer, Robert; Schulz, Anita; Roques, Caroline; Li, Shu; Bronich, Tatiana K; Batrakova, Elena V; Jordan, Rainer; Kabanov, Alexander V; 2R01 CA89225/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P20 RR021937-01A2/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; P20 RR021937-026644/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; R01 CA089225-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA089225-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA089225-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA089225-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Biomaterials. 2010 Jun;31(18):4972-9.

Loss- and gain-of-function analysis in a prostate sphere assay indicates that Bmi-1 expression is required for self-renewal activity and maintenance of p63(+) stem cells. Loss of Bmi-1 blocks the self-renewal activity induced by heightened beta-catenin signaling, suggesting that Bmi-1 is required for full activity of another self-renewal pathway. In vivo, Bmi-1 expression is necessary for normal prostate tubule regeneration. Altered self-renewal and proliferation through Bmi-1 modulation diminishes the susceptibility of prostate cells to transformation. In an in vivo prostate regeneration system, Bmi-1 inhibition protects prostate cells from FGF10-driven hyperplasia and slows the growth of aggressive Pten-deletion-induced prostate cancer. We conclude that Bmi-1 is a crucial regulator of self-renewal in adult prostate cells and plays important roles in prostate cancer initiation and progression.</abstract><notes>Lukacs, Rita U; Memarzadeh, Sanaz; Wu, Hong; Witte, Owen N; R01 CA107166/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA107166-05S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; UO1 CA84128-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Howard Hughes Medical Institute/; Cell Stem Cell. 2010 Dec 3;7(6):682-93.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21112563</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3019762</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.stem.2010.11.013</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>751</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">751</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Love, K.

While studies have demonstrated the potential of gene silencing in vivo, improvements in delivery efficacy are required to fulfill the broadest potential of RNA interference therapeutics. Through the combinatorial synthesis and screening of a different class of materials, a formulation has been identified that enables siRNA-directed liver gene silencing in mice at doses below 0.01 mg/kg. This formulation was also shown to specifically inhibit expression of five hepatic genes simultaneously, after a single injection. The potential of this formulation was further validated in nonhuman primates, where high levels of knockdown of the clinically relevant gene transthyretin was observed at doses as low as 0.03 mg/kg. To our knowledge, this formulation facilitates gene silencing at orders-of-magnitude lower doses than required by any previously described siRNA liver delivery system.</abstract><notes>Love, Kevin T; Mahon, Kerry P; Levins, Christopher G; Whitehead, Kathryn A; Querbes, William; Dorkin, J Robert; Qin, June; Cantley, William; Qin, Liu Liang; Racie, Timothy; Frank-Kamenetsky, Maria; Yip, Ka Ning; Alvarez, Rene; Sah, Dinah W Y; de Fougerolles, Antonin; Fitzgerald, Kevin; Koteliansky, Victor; Akinc, Akin; Langer, Robert; Anderson, Daniel G; EB000244/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Feb 2;107(5):1864-9.

Among these markers, DNA fragment size has shown promise for discerning the source of CNA molecules in cancer and prenatal diagnostics. We have developed a one-step assay for analyzing circulating DNA size and quantity directly in human serum. Microfluidic cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy and fluorescence burst size analysis are used to individually count and size fluorescently-labeled CNA molecules as they are driven through a microfluidic constriction. First, single molecule sizing was performed on lambda Hind III digest DNA to obtain a size calibration curve. A linear relation between DNA length and burst size was seen from 564 bp to 27.5 kbp. Subsequently, the single molecule assay parameters were optimized. Finally, DNA sizing analysis was performed on serum samples from both early and late stage lung cancer patients. This assay was performed directly in patient serum using only a single reagent, a simple DNA intercalating dye, and without the need for DNA isolation or enzymatic amplification steps. This demonstrates that microfluidic single molecule spectroscopy can be a rapid, facile, and inexpensive alternative to the established PCR-based methods that have been used near exclusively for CNA analysis.</abstract><notes>Liu, Kelvin J; Brock, Malcolm V; Shih, Ie-Ming; Wang, Tza-Huei; P50 CA058184-17/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21 CA120742-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21 CA120742-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21-CA120742-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151838-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54-AI057168-06/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/; J Am Chem Soc. 2010 Apr 28;132(16):5793-8.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20364832</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3273337</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/ja100342q</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>626</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">626</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, K.</author><author>Chen, Y.

Particularly for screening applications, there is a need for control of slug parameters such as size and composition. We describe a new microfluidic approach for creating slugs in air, each comprising a size and composition that can be selected individually for each slug. Two-component slugs are formed by first metering the desired volume of each reagent, merging the two volumes into an end-to-end slug, and propelling the slug to induce mixing. Volume control is achieved by a novel mechanism: two closed chambers on the chip are initially filled with air, and a valve in each is briefly opened to admit one of the reagents. The pressure of each reagent can be individually selected and determines the amount of air compression, and thus the amount of liquid that is admitted into each chamber. We describe the theory of operation, characterize the slug generation chip, and demonstrate the creation of slugs of different compositions. The use of microvalves in this approach enables robust operation with different liquids, and also enables one to work with extremely small samples, even down to a few slug volumes. The latter is important for applications involving precious reagents such as optimizing the reaction conditions for radiolabeling biological molecules as tracers for positron emission tomography.

Although chemists have reported a few examples of supramolecular assembly in water, the controlled covalent synthesis of large molecules and structures in vivo has remained challenging. Here we report a condensation reaction between 1,2-aminothiol and 2-cyanobenzothiazole that occurs in vitro and in living cells under the control of either pH, disulfide reduction or enzymatic cleavage. In vitro, the size and shape of the condensation products, and the nanostructures subsequently assembled, were different in each case and could thus be controlled by tuning the structure of the monomers. Direct imaging of the products obtained in the cells revealed their locations-near the Golgi bodies under enzymatic cleavage control-demonstrating the feasibility of a controlled and localized reaction in living cells. This intracellular condensation process enabled the imaging of the proteolytic activity of furin.</abstract><notes>Liang, Gaolin; Ren, Hongjun; Rao, Jianghong; R01GM086196-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.; England; Nature chemistry; Nat Chem. 2010 Jan;2(1):54-60.

Based on the previous formulation, liposome-polycation-DNA (LPD), which was a DNA-protamine complex wrapped by cationic liposome followed by post-insertion of PEG, LCP was similar to LPD NP except that the core was replaced by a biodegradable nano-sized calcium phosphate precipitate prepared by using water-in-oil micro-emulsions in which siRNA was entrapped. We hypothesized that after entering the cells, LCP would de-assemble at low pH in the endosome, which would cause endosome swelling and bursting to release the entrapped siRNA. Such a mechanism was demonstrated by the increase of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration as shown by using a calcium specific dye Fura-2. The LCP NP was further modified by post-insertion of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with or without anisamide, a sigma-1 receptor ligand for systemic administration. Luciferase siRNA was used to evaluate the gene silencing effect in H-460 cells which were stably transduced with a luciferase gene. The anisamide modified LCP NP silenced about 70% and 50% of luciferase activity for the tumor cells in culture and those grown in a xenograft model, respectively. The untargeted NP showed a very low silencing effect. The new formulation improved the in vitro silencing effect 3-4 folds compared to the previous LPD formulation, but had a negligible immunotoxicity.</abstract><notes>Li, Jun; Chen, Yun-Ching; Tseng, Yu-Cheng; Mozumdar, Subho; Huang, Leaf; CA129835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R01 CA129835-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R01 CA149363-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Netherlands; Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society; J Control Release. 2010 Mar 19;142(3):416-21.

We report here the design, synthesis, and evaluation of an activatable probe that shows great promise for enabling detection of the cleaved probe in the presence of high levels of nonactivated, uncleaved probe, a difficult task to attain in absorbance-based modality. Before the cleavage by its target, proteolytic enzyme MMP-2, the probe, an activatable cell-penetrating peptide, Ceeee[Ahx]PLGLAGrrrrrK, labeled with two chromophores, BHQ3 and Alexa750, shows photoacoustic signals of similar intensity at the two wavelengths corresponding to the absorption maxima of the chromophores, 675 and 750 nm. Subtraction of the images taken at these two wavelengths makes the probe effectively photoacoustically silent, as the signals at these two wavelengths essentially cancel out. After the cleavage, the dye associated with the cell-penetrating part of the probe, BHQ3, accumulates in the cells, while the other dye diffuses away, resulting in photoacoustic signal seen at only one of the wavelengths, 675 nm. Subtraction of the photoacoustic images at two wavelengths reveals the location of the cleaved (activated) probe. In the search for the chromophores that are best suited for photoacoustic imaging, we have investigated the photoacoustic signals of five chromophores absorbing in the near-infrared region. We have found that the photoacoustic signal did not correlate with the absorbance and fluorescence of the molecules, as the highest photoacoustic signal arose from the least absorbing quenchers, BHQ3 and QXL 680.</abstract><notes>Levi, Jelena&#xD;Kothapalli, Sri Rajasekhar&#xD;Ma, Te-Jen&#xD;Hartman, Keith&#xD;Khuri-Yakub, Butrus T&#xD;Gambhir, Sanjiv Sam&#xD;P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA114747-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;J Am Chem Soc. 2010 Aug 18;132(32):11264-9.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20698693</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2922742</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/ja104000a</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>770</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">770</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leuschner, F.</author><author>Panizzi, P.</author><author>Chico-Calero, I.</author><author>Lee, W.

OBJECTIVE: Because monocytes are centrally involved in tissue repair after ischemia, we hypothesized that early angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy impacts healing after myocardial infarction partly via effects on monocyte traffic. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a mouse model of permanent coronary ligation, enalapril arrested the release of monocytes from the splenic reservoir and consequently reduced their recruitment into the healing infarct by 45%, as quantified by flow cytometry of digested infarcts. Time-lapse intravital microscopy revealed that enalapril reduces monocyte motility in the spleen. In vitro migration assays and Western blotting showed that this was caused by reduced signaling through the Ang II type 1 receptor. We then studied the long-term consequences of blocked splenic monocyte release in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein (apo)E(-/-) mice, in which infarct healing is impaired because of excessive inflammation in the cardiac wound. Enalapril improved histologic healing biomarkers and reduced inflammation in infarcts measured by FMT-CT (fluorescence molecular tomography in conjunction with x-ray computed tomography) of proteolytic activity. ACE inhibition improved MRI-derived ejection fraction by 14% on day 21, despite initially comparable infarct size. In apoE(-/-) mice, ischemia/reperfusion injury resulted in larger infarct size and enhanced monocyte recruitment and was reversible by enalapril treatment. Splenectomy reproduced antiinflammatory effects of enalapril. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that benefits of early ACE inhibition after myocardial infarction can partially be attributed to its potent antiinflammatory impact on the splenic monocyte reservoir.</abstract><notes>Leuschner, Florian; Panizzi, Peter; Chico-Calero, Isabel; Lee, Won Woo; Ueno, Takuya; Cortez-Retamozo, Virna; Waterman, Peter; Gorbatov, Rostic; Marinelli, Brett; Iwamoto, Yoshiko; Chudnovskiy, Aleksey; Figueiredo, Jose-Luiz; Sosnovik, David E; Pittet, Mikael J; Swirski, Filip K; Weissleder, Ralph; Nahrendorf, Matthias; R00 HL094533/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 AI084880-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626-07/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 HL093038-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL095612-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL095629-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL095629-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL095629-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL096576/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL096576-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL096576-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01 HL096576-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01HL095629/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R01HL096576/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; R24 CA092782-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R24-CA92782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U01 HL080731-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; U01-HL08073/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; Circ Res. 2010 Nov 26;107(11):1364-73.

We report on a semiautomated sequencing algorithm and validate it through comparison against Edman degradation sequencing. The initial 44% sequencing success rate of the standard de novo sequencing software was improved to nearly 100%. The sequencing algorithm incorporates existing knowledge of amino acid chemistry and a new strategy for differentiating isobaric amino acids.

Imaging of fluorescence in vivo has become the most commonly used radiological tool in all pre-clinical work. In the last decade, full-body pre-clinical imaging systems have emerged with a wide range of utilities and niche application areas. The range of fluorescent probes that can be excited in the visible to near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum continues to expand, with the most value for in vivo use being beyond the 630 nm wavelength, because the absorption of light sharply decreases. Whole-body in vivo fluorescence imaging has not yet reached a state of maturity that allows its routine use in the scope of large-scale pre-clinical studies. This is in part due to an incomplete understanding of what the actual fundamental capabilities and limitations of this imaging modality are. However, progress is continuously being made in research laboratories pushing the limits of the approach to consistently improve its performance in terms of spatial resolution, sensitivity and quantification. This paper reviews this imaging technology with a particular emphasis on its potential uses and limitations, the required instrumentation, and the possible imaging geometries and applications. A detailed account of the main commercially available systems is provided as well as some perspective relating to the future of the technology development. Although the vast majority of applications of in vivo small animal imaging are based on epi-illumination planar imaging, the future success of the method relies heavily on the design of novel imaging systems based on state-of-the-art optical technology used in conjunction with high spatial resolution structural modalities such as MRI, CT or ultrasound.</abstract><notes>Leblond, Frederic; Davis, Scott C; Valdes, Pablo A; Pogue, Brian W; K25 CA138578-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; K25CA138578/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA109558-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA120368-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA120368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Switzerland; J Photochem Photobiol B. 2010 Jan 21;98(1):77-94.

Our goal was to characterize the phenotype of ALDH1A1-positive ovarian cancer cells and examine the biological effects of ALDH1A1 gene silencing. In our analysis of multiple ovarian cancer cell lines, we found that ALDH1A1 expression and activity was significantly higher in taxane- and platinum-resistant cell lines. In patient samples, 72.9% of ovarian cancers had ALDH1A1 expression in which the percentage of ALDH1A1-positive cells correlated negatively with progression-free survival (6.05 vs. 13.81 months; P &lt; 0.035). Subpopulations of A2780cp20 cells with ALDH1A1 activity were isolated for orthotopic tumor-initiating studies, where tumorigenicity was approximately 50-fold higher with ALDH1A1-positive cells. Interestingly, tumors derived from ALDH1A1-positive cells gave rise to both ALDH1A1-positive and ALDH1A1-negative populations, but ALDH1A1-negative cells could not generate ALDH1A1-positive cells. In an in vivo orthotopic mouse model of ovarian cancer, ALDH1A1 silencing using nanoliposomal siRNA sensitized both taxane- and platinum-resistant cell lines to chemotherapy, significantly reducing tumor growth in mice compared with chemotherapy alone (a 74%-90% reduction; P &lt; 0.015). These data show that the ALDH1A1 subpopulation is associated with chemoresistance and outcome in ovarian cancer patients, and targeting ALDH1A1 sensitizes resistant cells to chemotherapy. ALDH1A1-positive cells have enhanced, but not absolute, tumorigenicity but do have differentiation capacity lacking in ALDH1A1-negative cells. This enzyme may be important for identification and targeting of chemoresistant cell populations in ovarian cancer.</abstract><notes>Landen, Charles N Jr; Goodman, Blake; Katre, Ashwini A; Steg, Adam D; Nick, Alpa M; Stone, Rebecca L; Miller, Lance D; Mejia, Pablo Vivas; Jennings, Nicolas B; Gershenson, David M; Bast, Robert C Jr; Coleman, Robert L; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K; CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA109298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA110793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; K12 HD000849-12/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/; K12 HD00849/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/; L30 CA135771-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; RC2GM092599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 Dec;9(12):3186-99.

In the present work, we describe a self-assembled polymeric nanoparticle (NP) platform to target and control precisely the codelivery of drugs with varying physicochemical properties to cancer cells. As proof of concept, we codelivered cisplatin and docetaxel (Dtxl) to prostate cancer cells with synergistic cytotoxicity. A polylactide (PLA) derivative with pendant hydroxyl groups was prepared and conjugated to a platinum(IV) [Pt(IV)] prodrug, c,t,c-[Pt(NH(3))(2)(O(2)CCH(2)CH(2)COOH)(OH)Cl(2)] [PLA-Pt(IV)]. A blend of PLA-Pt(IV) functionalized polymer and carboxyl-terminated poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymer in the presence or absence of Dtxl, was converted, in microfluidic channels, to NPs with a diameter of approximately 100 nm. This process resulted in excellent encapsulation efficiency (EE) and high loading of both hydrophilic platinum prodrug and hydrophobic Dtxl with reproducible EEs and loadings. The surface of the NPs was derivatized with the A10 aptamer, which binds to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate cancer cells. These NPs undergo controlled release of both drugs over a period of 48-72 h. Targeted NPs were internalized by the PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells via endocytosis, and formation of cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cross-links on nuclear DNA was verified. In vitro toxicities demonstrated superiority of the targeted dual-drug combination NPs over NPs with single drug or nontargeted NPs. This work reveals the potential of a single, programmable nanoparticle to blend and deliver a combination of drugs for cancer treatment.</abstract><notes>Kolishetti, Nagesh; Dhar, Shanta; Valencia, Pedro M; Lin, Lucy Q; Karnik, Rohit; Lippard, Stephen J; Langer, Robert; Farokhzad, Omid C; CA034992/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; CA119349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB003647/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Oct 19;107(42):17939-44.

For identification of structural changes of pulmonary surfactant protein B (SP-B) due to the heterogeneous reaction with O(3), field-induced droplet ionization (FIDI) mass spectrometry has been utilized. FIDI is a soft ionization method in which ions are extracted from the surface of microliter-volume droplets. We report structurally specific oxidative changes of SP-B(1-25) (a shortened version of human SP-B) at the air-liquid interface. We also present studies of the interfacial oxidation of SP-B(1-25) in a nonionizable 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol (POG) surfactant layer as a model PS system, where competitive oxidation of the two components is observed. Our results indicate that the heterogeneous reaction of SP-B(1-25) at the interface is quite different from that in the solution phase. In comparison with the nearly complete homogeneous oxidation of SP-B(1-25), only a subset of the amino acids known to react with ozone are oxidized by direct ozonolysis in the hydrophobic interfacial environment, both with and without the lipid surfactant layer. Combining these experimental observations with the results of molecular dynamics simulations provides an improved understanding of the interfacial structure and chemistry of a model lung surfactant system subjected to oxidative stress.</abstract><notes>Kim, Hugh I; Kim, Hyungjun; Shin, Young Shik; Beegle, Luther W; Jang, Seung Soon; Neidholdt, Evan L; Goddard, William A; Heath, James R; Kanik, Isik; Beauchamp, J L; 5U54 CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119347-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Am Chem Soc. 2010 Feb 24;132(7):2254-63.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20121208</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2830728</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/ja908477w</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1232</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1232</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kempen, P.

Tumor-necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is such a therapeutic cytokine with selective killing effect toward malignant cells. However, some human pancreatic cancers are intrinsically resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis or therapy. In this study, we have shown that the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 can synergize with TRAIL to augment apoptosis even in TRAIL-resistant cells. LBH589 decreased c-FLIP levels in every tested cell line and survivin levels in some of the tested cell lines. Enforced expression of ectopic c-FLIP, but not survivin, abolished the cooperative induction of apoptosis by the combination of LBH589 and TRAIL, indicating that c-FLIP downregulation plays a critical role in LBH589 sensitization of pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL. Moreover, LBH589 decreased c-FLIP stability and the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented c-FLIP from reduction by LBH589. Correspondingly, we detected increased levels of ubiqutinated c-FLIP in LBH589-treated cells. These data thus indicate that LBH589 promotes ubiqutin/proteasome-mediated degradation of c-FLIP, leading to downregulation of c-FLIP. Collectively, LBH589 induces c-FLIP degradation and accordingly sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, highlighting a novel therapeutic regimen against pancreatic cancer.</abstract><notes>Kauh, John; Fan, Songqing; Xia, Mingjing; Yue, Ping; Yang, Lily; Khuri, Fadlo R; Sun, Shi-Yong; PLoS One. 2010 Apr 28;5(4):e10376.</notes><work-type>Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20442774</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2860986</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0010376</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1198</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1198</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jeong, W.</author><author>Napier, M.

A new particle fabrication process, particle replication in nonwetting templates (PRINT), has recently begun to attempt to emulate nature&apos;s ability to control those physical and chemical traits. The PRINT technology, which combines modern soft lithography with the unique properties of perfluoropolyether molds, enables the production of nanoparticles with unprecedented control of size, shape, chemical composition, deformability and surface functionality. This scalable &apos;top-down&apos; fabrication process allows for the generation of well-defined nanostructures without the need for molecular assembly. The ability to flexibly engineer various matrix materials offers unique opportunities for the development of nanomedicines with desired functionality. The strength and versatility of PRINT makes it a powerful platform in nanomedicine for elucidating the role of physical and chemical properties of nanodelivery vehicles on the behavior and fate at the cellular, tissue and whole organism level. Utilizing the PRINT technology, we are generating well-defined nanomedicines with tailored properties for preclinical studies against a variety of human diseases.</abstract><notes>Jeong, Wonhee&#xD;Napier, Mary E&#xD;DeSimone, Joseph M&#xD;England&#xD;London, England&#xD;Nanomedicine (Lond). 2010 Jun;5(4):633-9.</notes><work-type>Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20528457</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.2217/nnm.10.34</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1257</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1257</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jain, S.

Here we report quantitative tumor uptake studies for a class of elongated gold nanocrystals (called nanorods) that are covalently conjugated to tumor-targeting peptides. A major advantage in using gold as a &quot;tracer&quot; is that the accumulated gold in tumors and other organs can be quantitatively determined by elemental mass spectrometry (gold is not a natural element found in animals). Thus, colloidal gold nanorods are stabilized with a layer of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) and are conjugated to three different ligands: (i) a single-chain variable fragment (ScFv) peptide that recognizes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); (ii) an amino terminal fragment (ATF) peptide that recognizes the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR); and (iii) a cyclic RGD peptide that recognizes the a(v)beta(3) integrin receptor. Quantitative pharmacokinetic and biodistribution data show that these targeting ligands only marginally improve the total gold accumulation in xenograft tumor models in comparison with nontargeted controls, but their use could greatly alter the intracellular and extracellular nanoparticle distributions. When the gold nanorods are administered via intravenous injection, we also find that active molecular targeting of the tumor microenvironments (e.g., fibroblasts, macrophages, and vasculatures) does not significantly influence the tumor nanoparticle uptake. These results suggest that for photothermal cancer therapy, the preferred route of gold nanorod administration is intratumoral injection instead of intravenous injection.</abstract><notes>Huang, Xiaohua; Peng, Xianghong; Wang, Yiqing; Wang, Yuxiang; Shin, Dong M; El-Sayed, Mostafa A; Nie, Shuming; P50 CA128613-010004/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50CA128613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119338-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA119338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2010 Oct 26;4(10):5887-96.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20863096</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2964428</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/nn102055s</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>839</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">839</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, X.</author><author>Kang, B.</author><author>Qian, W.</author><author>Mackey, M.

Cytoplasm localization is achieved using arginine-glycine-aspartate peptide modified gold nanospheres, which target integrin receptors on the cell surface and are subsequently internalized by the cells. Nuclear delivery is achieved by conjugating the gold nanospheres with nuclear localization sequence peptides originating from the simian virus. Photothermal experiments show that cell death can be induced with a single pulse of a nanosecond laser more efficiently than with a cw laser. When the cw laser is applied, gold nanospheres localized in the cytoplasm are more effective in inducing cell destruction than gold nanospheres localized at the nucleus. The opposite effect is observed when the nanosecond pulsed laser is used, suggesting that plasmonic field enhancement of the nonlinear absorption processes occurs at high localization of gold nanospheres at the nucleus. Cell death pathways are further investigated via a standard apoptosis kit to show that the cell death mechanisms depend on the type of laser used. While the cw laser induces cell death via apoptosis, the nanosecond pulsed laser leads to cell necrosis.

Mesoporous silica thin films with tunable features at the nanoscale were fabricated using the triblock copolymer template pathway. Using different templates and concentrations in the precursor solution, various pore size distributions, pore structures, and connectivity were obtained and applied for selective recovery of low mass proteins. In combination with mass spectrometry and statistic analysis, we demonstrated the correlation between the nanophase characteristics of the mesoporous silica thin films and the specificity and efficacy of low mass proteome harvesting. In addition, to overcome the limitations of the prefunctionalization method in polymer selection, plasma ashing was used for the first time for the treatment of the mesoporous silica surface prior to chemical modification. Surface charge modifications by different functional groups resulted in a selective capture of the low molecular weight proteins from serum sample. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the ability to tune the physicochemical properties of mesoporous silica surfaces, for a selective enrichment of the low molecular weight proteome from complex biological fluids, has the potential to promote proteomic biomarker discovery.</abstract><notes>Hu, Ye&#xD;Bouamrani, Ali&#xD;Tasciotti, Ennio&#xD;Li, Li&#xD;Liu, Xuewu&#xD;Ferrari, Mauro&#xD;R01 CA128797-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA128797-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA128797-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01CA128797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R21 CA122864-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R21/R33CA122864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R33 CA122864-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R33 CA122864-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;ACS Nano. 2010 Jan 26;4(1):439-51.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20014864</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2814324</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/nn901322d</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1196</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1196</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hsieh, J.

However, mice genetically engineered to express Kras(G12D) from its endogenous locus develop PDACs only after a prolonged latency, indicating that other genetic events or pathway alterations are necessary for PDAC progression. The PTEN-controlled phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling axis is dysregulated in later stages of PDAC. To better elucidate the role of PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling in Kras(G12D)-induced PDAC development, we crossed Pten conditional knockout mice (Pten(lox/lox)) to mice with conditional activation of Kras(G12D). The resulting compound heterozygous mutant mice showed significantly accelerated development of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), malignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPanIN), and PDAC within a year. Moreover, all mice with Kras(G12D) activation and Pten homozygous deletion succumbed to cancer by 3 weeks of age. Our data support a dosage-dependent role for PTEN, and the resulting dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling axis, in both PDAC initiation and progression, and shed additional light on the signaling mechanisms that lead to the development of ADM and subsequent mPanIN and pancreatic cancer.</abstract><notes>Hill, Reginald; Calvopina, Joseph Hargan; Kim, Christine; Wang, Ying; Dawson, David W; Donahue, Timothy R; Dry, Sarah; Wu, Hong; R01 CA107166/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA107166-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA121110-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA009056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; UO1 CA84128/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Res. 2010 Sep 15;70(18):7114-24.

Deletion of the phosphatase Pten (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) reduces PIP3 levels and leads to fatty liver development. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying lipogenesis that result from PIP3 accumulation using liver Pten-deletion mice. To explore the role of AKT2, the major liver AKT isoform in steatosis induced by deletion of Pten, we created mice lacking both Pten and Akt2 in hepatocytes and compared the effect of deleting Akt2 and Pten in the double mutants to the Pten deletion mice alone. Hepatic lipid accumulation was significantly reduced in mice lacking both PTEN and AKT2, as compared with Pten mutant mice alone. This effect was due to the role of AKT2 in maintaining expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis. We showed that lipid accumulation in the double mutant hepatocytes was partially reversed by expression of constitutive active FOXO1, a transcription factor downstream of AKT not dependent on inhibition of atypical protein kinase C. In summary, this study delineated regulation of lipid metabolism by PI3K signaling pathway by showing that AKT mediates PIP3 accumulation (mimicked by PTEN loss) induced lipid deposition in the liver and provided an important molecular mechanism for insulin-regulated hepatic lipogenesis.</abstract><notes>He, Lina; Hou, Xiaogang; Kanel, Gary; Zeng, Ni; Galicia, Vivian; Wang, Ying; Yang, Jian; Wu, Hong; Birnbaum, Morris J; Stiles, Bangyan L; R01-DK56886/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/; Am J Pathol. 2010 May;176(5):2302-8.

Motivated by these properties and by current clinical needs, numerous diagnostic and therapeutic nanomaterials have recently emerged. Here we describe a novel nanoparticle targeting platform that uses a rapid, catalyst-free cycloaddition as the coupling mechanism. Antibodies against biomarkers of interest were modified with trans-cyclooctene and used as scaffolds to couple tetrazine-modified nanoparticles onto live cells. We show that the technique is fast, chemoselective, adaptable to metal nanomaterials, and scalable for biomedical use. This method also supports amplification of biomarker signals, making it superior to alternative targeting techniques including avidin/biotin.</abstract><notes>Haun, Jered B; Devaraj, Neal K; Hilderbrand, Scott A; Lee, Hakho; Weissleder, Ralph; K01 EB010078-02/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; K01 EB010078-04/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; P50 CA086355-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50CA86355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB004626-07/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB010011-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; England; Nat Nanotechnol. 2010 Sep;5(9):660-5.

However, in order for magnetic biosensing to become competitive with current optical protein microarray technology, there is a need to increase the number of sensors while maintaining the high sensitivity and fast readout time characteristic of smaller arrays (1-8 sensors). In this paper, we present a circuit architecture scalable for larger sensor arrays (64 individually addressable sensors) while maintaining a high readout rate (scanning the entire array in less than 4s). The system utilizes both time domain multiplexing and frequency domain multiplexing in order to achieve this scan rate. For the implementation, we propose a new circuit architecture that does not use a classical Wheatstone bridge to measure the small change in resistance of the sensor. Instead, an architecture designed around a transimpedance amplifier is employed. A detailed analysis of this architecture including the noise, distortion, and potential sources of errors is presented, followed by a global optimization strategy for the entire system comprising the magnetic tags, sensors, and interface electronics. To demonstrate the sensitivity, quantifiable detection of two blindly spiked samples of unknown concentrations has been performed at concentrations below the limit of detection for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lastly, the multiplexing capability and reproducibility of the system was demonstrated by simultaneously monitoring sensors functionalized with three unique proteins at different concentrations in real-time.</abstract><notes>Hall, D A; Gaster, R S; Lin, T; Osterfeld, S J; Han, S; Murmann, B; Wang, S X; 1U54CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Comparative Study; Evaluation Studies; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.; England; Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics; Biosens Bioelectron. 2010 May 15;25(9):2051-7.

A major barrier in the use of nanotechnology for brain tumor applications is the difficulty in delivering nanoparticles to intracranial tumors. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP; 10 nm in core size) conjugated to a purified antibody that selectively binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) deletion mutant (EGFRvIII) present on human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells were used for therapeutic targeting and MRI contrast enhancement of experimental glioblastoma, both in vitro and in vivo, after convection-enhanced delivery (CED). A significant decrease in glioblastoma cell survival was observed after nanoparticle treatment and no toxicity was observed with treatment of human astrocytes (P &lt; 0.001). Lower EGFR phosphorylation was found in glioblastoma cells after EGFRvIIIAb-IONP treatment. Apoptosis was determined to be the mode of cell death after treatment of GBM cells and glioblastoma stem cell-containing neurospheres with EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs. MRI-guided CED of EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs allowed for the initial distribution of magnetic nanoparticles within or adjacent to intracranial human xenograft tumors and continued dispersion days later. A significant increase in animal survival was found after CED of magnetic nanoparticles (P &lt; 0.01) in mice implanted with highly tumorigenic glioblastoma xenografts (U87DeltaEGFRvIII). IONPs conjugated to an antibody specific to the EGFRvIII deletion mutant constitutively expressed by human glioblastoma tumors can provide selective MRI contrast enhancement of tumor cells and targeted therapy of infiltrative glioblastoma cells after CED.</abstract><notes>Hadjipanayis, Costas G; Machaidze, Revaz; Kaluzova, Milota; Wang, Liya; Schuette, Albert J; Chen, Hongwei; Wu, Xinying; Mao, Hui; 54 CA119338-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; K08 NS053454-01A1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; K08 NS053454-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; K08 NS053454-03/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; K08 NS053454-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; K08 NS053454-05/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; NS053454/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/; P50CA128301-01A10003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Res. 2010 Aug 1;70(15):6303-12.

Moreover, RNA has a flexible structure and possesses catalytic functions that are similar to proteins. Although RNA nanotechnology resembles DNA nanotechnology in many ways, the base-pairing rules for constructing nanoparticles are different. The large variety of loops and motifs found in RNA allows it to fold into numerous complicated structures, and this diversity provides a platform for identifying viable building blocks for various applications. The thermal stability of RNA also allows the production of multivalent nanostructures with defined stoichiometry. Here we review techniques for constructing RNA nanoparticles from different building blocks, we describe the distinct attributes of RNA inside the body, and discuss potential applications of RNA nanostructures in medicine. We also offer some perspectives on the yield and cost of RNA production.</abstract><notes>Guo, Peixuan&#xD;EB003730/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;GM059944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;PN2 EY018230/EY/NEI NIH HHS/&#xD;PN2 EY018230-01/EY/NEI NIH HHS/&#xD;PN2 EY018230-02/EY/NEI NIH HHS/&#xD;PN2 EY018230-03/EY/NEI NIH HHS/&#xD;PN2 EY018230-04/EY/NEI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB003730-05/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 EB003730-06/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 GM059944-06/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 GM059944-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 GM059944-08/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 GM059944-09/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/&#xD;England&#xD;Nat Nanotechnol. 2010 Dec;5(12):833-42.

These mutations alter kinase-mediated signaling function and phenotypic outcome. An information theoretic analysis of the correlation of phosphoproteomic profiling and transformation potency of the oncogene in different mutants is presented. The theory seeks to predict the leukemic transformation potency from the observed signaling by constructing a distribution of maximal entropy of site-specific phosphorylation events. The theory is developed with special reference to systems biology where high throughput measurements are typical. We seek sets of phosphorylation events most contributory to predicting the phenotype by determining the constraints on the signaling system. The relevance of a constraint is measured by how much it reduces the value of the entropy from its global maximum, where all events are equally likely. Application to experimental phospho-proteomics data for kinase inhibitor-resistant mutants shows that there is one dominant constraint and that other constraints are not relevant to a similar extent. This single constraint accounts for much of the correlation of phosphorylation events with the oncogenic potency and thereby usefully predicts the trends in the phenotypic output. An additional constraint possibly accounts for biological fine structure.</abstract><notes>Graeber, T G; Heath, J R; Skaggs, B J; Phelps, M E; Remacle, F; Levine, R D; 5U54 CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; HG002807/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/; K01 AR059095-02/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Mar 30;107(13):6112-7.

A broad spectrum of nanoparticles are currently under development, exhibiting differences in (i) size, ranging from few tens of nanometers to few microns; (ii) shape, from the classical spherical beads to discoidal, hemispherical, cylindrical, and conical; (iii) surface functionalization, with a wide range of electrostatic charges and biomolecule conjugations. Clearly, the library of nanoparticles generated by combining all possible sizes, shapes, and surface physicochemical properties is enormous. With such a complex scenario, an integrated approach is here proposed and described for the rational design of nanoparticle systems (nanovectors) for the intravascular delivery of therapeutic and imaging contrast agents. The proposed integrated approach combines multiscale/multiphysics mathematical models with in vitro assays and in vivo intravital microscopy (IVM) experiments and aims at identifying the optimal combination of size, shape, and surface properties that maximize the nanovectors localization within the diseased microvasculature.</abstract><notes>Godin, Biana; Driessen, Wouter H P; Proneth, Bettina; Lee, Sei-Young; Srinivasan, Srimeenakshi; Rumbaut, Rolando; Arap, Wadih; Pasqualini, Renata; Ferrari, Mauro; Decuzzi, Paolo; U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Adv Genet. 2010;69:31-64.</notes><work-type>Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, P.H.S.; Review</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20807601</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0065-2660(10)69009-8</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>575</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">575</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Glazer, E.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) are potentially therapeutic because of the safety demonstrated thus far and their physiochemical characteristics. We used the astounding heating rates of AuNPs in nonionizing radiofrequency (RF) radiation to investigate human pancreatic xenograft destruction in a murine model. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Weekly, Panc-1 and Capan-1 human pancreatic carcinoma xenografts in immunocompromised mice were exposed to an RF field 36 hours after treatment (intraperitoneal) with cetuximab- or PAM4 antibody-conjugated AuNPs, respectively. Tumor sizes were measured weekly, whereas necrosis and cleaved caspase-3 were investigated with hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunofluorescence, respectively. In addition, AuNP internalization and cytotoxicity were investigated in vitro with confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: Panc-1 cells demonstrated increased apoptosis with decreased viability after treatment with cetuximab-conjugated AuNPs and RF field exposure (P = 0.00005). Differences in xenograft volumes were observed within 2 weeks of initiating therapy. Cetuximab- and PAM4-conjugated AuNPs demonstrated RF field-induced destruction of Panc-1 and Capan-1 pancreatic carcinoma xenografts after 6 weeks of weekly treatment (P = 0.004 and P = 0.035, respectively). There was no evidence of injury to murine organs. Cleaved caspase-3 and necrosis were both increased in treated tumors. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a potentially novel cancer therapy by noninvasively inducing intracellular hyperthermia with targeted AuNPs in an RF field. While the therapy is dependent on the specificity of the targeting antibody, normal tissues were without toxicity despite systemic therapy and whole-body RF field exposure.</abstract><notes>Glazer, Evan S; Zhu, Cihui; Massey, Katheryn L; Thompson, C Shea; Kaluarachchi, Warna D; Hamir, Amir N; Curley, Steven A; CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA009599-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; T32 CA09599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151668-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA143837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Dec 1;16(23):5712-21.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21138869</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3057504</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2055</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1040</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1040</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gibbs-Strauss, S.

The study goals were to assess the range of use for treatment monitoring and stratification of tumor types using epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) status with administration of fluorescently labeled EGF and determine its utility for tumor detection compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: EGFR+ and EGFR- glioma tumor lines (human glioma [U251-GFP] and rat gliosarcoma [9L-GFP], respectively) were used to assess these goals, having a 20-fold difference between their EGF uptakes. RESULTS: Treatment with cetuximab in the EGFR+ tumor-bearing animals led to decreased EGF tumor uptake, whereas for the EGFR- tumors, no change in fluorescence signal followed treatment. This diagnostic difference in EGFR expression could be used to stratify the tumor-bearing animals into groups of potential responders and nonresponders, and receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 in separating these tumors. The nonlocalized growth pattern of U251-GFP tumors resulted in detection difficulty on standard MRI, but high EGFR expression made them detectable by fluorescence imaging (AUC = 1.0). The EGFR+ U251-GFP tumor-bearing animals could be noninvasively stratified into treated and untreated groups on the basis of fluorescence intensity difference (P = .035, AUC = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: EGFR expression was tracked in vivo with fluorescence and determined to be of use for the stratification of EGFR+ and EGFR- tumors, the detection of EGFR+ tumors, and monitoring of molecular therapy.</abstract><notes>Gibbs-Strauss, Summer L; Samkoe, Kimberley S; O&apos;Hara, Julia A; Davis, Scott C; Hoopes, P Jack; Hasan, Tayyaba; Pogue, Brian W; P01 CA084203-020003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01CA84203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA109558-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Acad Radiol. 2010 Jan;17(1):7-17.

Here we report on the dynamics of release using fluorophore-terminated C6 or C11 thiols. We show that the release kinetics for C6 thiols are determined solely by diffusive transport, whereas for C11 thiols the release kinetics are attenuated by the low solubility that limits the rate at which the desorbed thiols can diffuse away from the surface. The release of multiple different molecules from the same electrode is demonstrated using red- and green-emitting fluorophores.

Oral administration of the mice with CUR at 50 mg/kg for 3 consecutive days resulted in a down regulation of intestinal P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and cytochrome P450 3A2 (CYP3A2) protein levels. PTX, a Pgp and CYP3A2 substrate, was administered orally at 20 mg/kg in solution or nanoemulsion either as single agent or upon pretreatment with CUR at 50 mg/kg in tumor-bearing mice. Plasma AUC(0-infinity) of PTX administered in nanoemulsion to CUR pretreated mice showed 4.1-fold increase relative to controls. Similarly, relative PTX bioavailability was increased by 5.2-fold, resulting in a 3.2-fold higher PTX accumulation in the tumor tissue. PTX administered in nanoemulsion to CUR pretreated mice also showed significantly enhanced anti-tumor activity. Preliminary safety evaluation showed that CUR + PTX combination did not induce any acute toxicity as measured by body weight changes, blood cell counts, liver enzyme levels, and liver histopathology. The results of this study suggest that combination of PTX and CUR, administered in nanoemulsions, could improve oral bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy in ovarian adenocarcinoma.</abstract><notes>Ganta, Srinivas; Devalapally, Harikrishna; Amiji, Mansoor; R01-CA119617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Pharm Sci. 2010 Nov;99(11):4630-41.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20845461</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jps.22157</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>767</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">767</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fourches, D.</author><author>Pu, D.</author><author>Tassa, C. </author><author>Weissleder, R.</author><author>Shaw, S.

Experimental studies, especially toxicological, are time-consuming, costly, and often impractical, calling for the development of efficient computational approaches capable of predicting biological effects of MNPs. To this end, we have investigated the potential of cheminformatics methods such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling to establish statistically significant relationships between measured biological activity profiles of MNPs and their physical, chemical, and geometrical properties, either measured experimentally or computed from the structure of MNPs. To reflect the context of the study, we termed our approach quantitative nanostructure-activity relationship (QNAR) modeling. We have employed two representative sets of MNPs studied recently using in vitro cell-based assays: (i) 51 various MNPs with diverse metal cores (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2008, 105, 7387-7392) and (ii) 109 MNPs with similar core but diverse surface modifiers (Nat. Biotechnol. 2005, 23, 1418-1423). We have generated QNAR models using machine learning approaches such as support vector machine (SVM)-based classification and k nearest neighbors (kNN)-based regression; their external prediction power was shown to be as high as 73% for classification modeling and having an R(2) of 0.72 for regression modeling. Our results suggest that QNAR models can be employed for: (i) predicting biological activity profiles of novel nanomaterials, and (ii) prioritizing the design and manufacturing of nanomaterials toward better and safer products.</abstract><notes>Fourches, Denis; Pu, Dongqiuye; Tassa, Carlos; Weissleder, Ralph; Shaw, Stanley Y; Mumper, Russell J; Tropsha, Alexander; R01 GM066940-01A1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; R01-GM66940/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/; U01 HL080731-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; U01-HL80731/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/; ACS Nano. 2010 Oct 26;4(10):5703-12.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20857979</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2997621</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/nn1013484</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>632</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">632</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fang, C.</author><author>Wang, Y.</author><author>Vu, N.

Accordingly, many successful molecularly targeted anticancer therapeutics are directed at inhibiting kinase activity. To assess kinase activity in minute patient samples, we have developed an immunocapture-based in vitro kinase assay on an integrated polydimethylsiloxane microfluidics platform that can reproducibly measure kinase activity from as few as 3,000 cells. For this platform, we adopted the standard radiometric (32)P-ATP-labeled phosphate transfer assay. Implementation on a microfluidic device required us to develop methods for repeated trapping and mixing of solid-phase affinity microbeads. We also developed a solid-state beta-particle camera imbedded directly below the microfluidic device for real-time quantitative detection of the signal from this and other microfluidic radiobioassays. We show that the resulting integrated device can measure ABL kinase activity from BCR-ABL-positive leukemia patient samples. The low sample input requirement of the device creates new potential for direct kinase activity experimentation and diagnostics on patient blood, bone marrow, and needle biopsy samples.</abstract><notes>Fang, Cong; Wang, Yanju; Vu, Nam T; Lin, Wei-Yu; Hsieh, Yao-Te; Rubbi, Liudmilla; Phelps, Michael E; Muschen, Markus; Kim, Yong-Mi; Chatziioannou, Arion F; Tseng, Hsian-Rong; Graeber, Thomas G; 5T32EB002101/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 CA137060-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA137060-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA139032-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA139032-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA137060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA139032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R21 CA152497-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Cancer Res. 2010 Nov 1;70(21):8299-308.

P-glycoprotein is an important and the best-known membrane transporter involved in MDR. Several strategies have been used to address MDR, especially P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance in tumors. However, clinical success has been limited, largely due to issues regarding lack of efficacy and/or safety. Nanoparticles have shown the ability to target tumors based on their unique physical and biological properties. To date, nanoparticles have been investigated primarily to address P-glycoprotein and the observed improved anticancer efficacy suggests that nanomedicinal strategies provide a new opportunity to overcome MDR. This article focuses on nanotechnology-based formulations and current nanomedicine approaches to address MDR in tumors and discusses the proposed mechanisms of action.</abstract><notes>Dong, Xiaowei; Mumper, Russell J; R01 CA115197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Review; England; Nanomedicine (London, England); Nanomedicine (Lond). 2010 Jun;5(4):597-615.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=20528455</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2925023</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.2217/nnm.10.35</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>802</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">802</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ding, H.</author><author>Inoue, S.</author><author>Ljubimov, A.

A polymeric nanobioconjugate drug based on biodegradable, nontoxic, and nonimmunogenic polymalic acid as a universal delivery nanoplatform was used for design and synthesis of nanomedicine drug for i.v. treatment of brain tumors. The polymeric drug passes through the BTB and tumor cell membrane using tandem monoclonal antibodies targeting the BTB and tumor cells. The next step for polymeric drug action was inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by specifically blocking the synthesis of a tumor neovascular trimer protein, laminin-411, by attached antisense oligonucleotides (AONs). The AONs were released into the target cell cytoplasm via pH-activated trileucine, an endosomal escape moiety. Drug delivery to the brain tumor and the release mechanism were both studied for this nanobiopolymer. Introduction of a trileucine endosome escape unit resulted in significantly increased AON delivery to tumor cells, inhibition of laminin-411 synthesis in vitro and in vivo, specific accumulation in brain tumors, and suppression of intracranial glioma growth compared with pH-independent leucine ester. The availability of a systemically active polymeric drug delivery system that passes through the BTB, targets tumor cells, and inhibits glioma growth gives hope for a successful strategy of glioma treatment. This delivery system with drug release into the brain-specific cell type could be useful for treatment of various brain pathologies.</abstract><notes>Ding, Hui; Inoue, Satoshi; Ljubimov, Alexander V; Patil, Rameshwar; Portilla-Arias, Jose; Hu, Jinwei; Konda, Bindu; Wawrowsky, Kolja A; Fujita, Manabu; Karabalin, Natalya; Sasaki, Takako; Black, Keith L; Holler, Eggehard; Ljubimova, Julia Y; CA123495/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EY13431/EY/NEI NIH HHS/; M01 RR00425/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Oct 19;107(42):18143-8.

However, since many diseases will not manifest an endogenous photoacoustic contrast, it is essential to develop exogenous photoacoustic contrast agents that can target diseased tissue(s). Here we present a novel photoacoustic contrast agent, Indocyanine Green dye-enhanced single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT-ICG). We conjugated this contrast agent with cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides to molecularly target the alpha(v)beta(3) integrins, which are associated with tumor angiogenesis. Intravenous administration of this tumor-targeted contrast agent to tumor-bearing mice showed significantly higher photoacoustic signal in the tumor than in mice injected with the untargeted contrast agent. The new contrast agent gave a markedly 300 times higher photoacoustic contrast in living tissues than previously reported SWNTs, leading to subnanomolar sensitivities. Finally, we show that the new contrast agent can detect approximately 20 times fewer cancer cells than previously reported SWNTs.</abstract><notes>de la Zerda, Adam&#xD;Liu, Zhuang&#xD;Bodapati, Sunil&#xD;Teed, Robert&#xD;Vaithilingam, Srikant&#xD;Khuri-Yakub, Butrus T&#xD;Chen, Xiaoyuan&#xD;Dai, Hongjie&#xD;Gambhir, Sanjiv Sam&#xD;P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA114747-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA135109-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;R01 CA135109-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Nano Lett. 2010 Jun 9;10(6):2168-72.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20499887</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2893026</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/nl100890d</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1185</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1185</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de la Zerda, A.</author><author>Bodapati, S.</author><author>Teed, R.</author><author>Schipper, M.

PROCEDURE: The instruments were compared for their sensitivity in phantoms and living mice, multiplexing capabilities (ability to resolve the signal of one QD type in the presence of another), and the dependence of contrast and spatial resolution as a function of depth. RESULTS: In phantoms, eXplore Optix had an order of magnitude better sensitivity compared to the SI systems, detecting QD concentrations of ~40 pM in vitro. Maestro was the best instrument for multiplexing QDs. Reduction of contrast and resolution as a function of depth was smallest with eXplore Optix for depth of 2-6 mm, while other depths gave comparable results in all systems. Sensitivity experiments in living mice showed that the eXplore Optix and Maestro systems outperformed the IVIS-Spectrum. CONCLUSION: TDI was found to be an order of magnitude more sensitive than SI at the expense of speed and very limited multiplexing capabilities. For deep tissue QD imaging, TDI is most applicable for depths between 2 and 6 mm, as its contrast and resolution degrade the least at these depths.</abstract><notes>de la Zerda, Adam&#xD;Bodapati, Sunil&#xD;Teed, Robert&#xD;Schipper, Meike L&#xD;Keren, Shay&#xD;Smith, Bryan R&#xD;Ng, Johnny S T&#xD;Gambhir, Sanjiv Sam&#xD;P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;P50 CA114747-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Mol Imaging Biol. 2010 Oct;12(5):500-8.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two orthotopic glioma xenograft models were used in this study: one represented high EGFR expression and the other low expression. Nude mice were inoculated with cells from either one of the tumor lines or were used in a sham surgery control group. Animals were imaged using a unique MRI-FMT scanner 48 hours after intravenous injection of a near-infrared fluorophore bound to epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand. Coronal images of fluorescence activity of the injected dye in the mouse brain were recovered using the MRI images as anatomical templates. RESULTS: In vivo images of fluorescence activity showed significant differences between animal populations, an observation confirmed by receiver operating characteristic analysis that revealed 100% sensitivity and specificity between animal groups implanted with EGFR((+)) and EGFR((-)) tumor lines. Similar performance was observed between EGFR((+)) and sham surgery control animals. CONCLUSIONS: This preclinical study suggests that MRI-FMT with fluorescent EGF provides excellent discrimination between tumors based on EGFR status. Reliable quantification of receptor status using minimally invasive techniques would be an important innovation for investigating new and existing cancer treatments that target these cellular mechanisms in research animals, and may be applied to identify receptor amplification in human brain cancer patients. This study represents the first systematic multianimal validation of receptor-specific imaging using MRI-guided fluorescence tomography.</abstract><notes>Davis, Scott C; Samkoe, Kimberley S; O&apos;Hara, Julia A; Gibbs-Strauss, Summer L; Payne, Hannah L; Hoopes, P Jack; Paulsen, Keith D; Pogue, Brian W; R01 CA069544-05A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA109558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA109558-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA69544/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Acad Radiol. 2010 Mar;17(3):271-6.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20152724</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2823000</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.acra.2009.11.001</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>616</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">616</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, M.

Long, double-stranded RNAs were first shown to mediate RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans, and the potential use of RNAi for human therapy has been demonstrated by the finding that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; approximately 21-base-pair double-stranded RNA) can elicit RNAi in mammalian cells without producing an interferon response. We are at present conducting the first in-human phase I clinical trial involving the systemic administration of siRNA to patients with solid cancers using a targeted, nanoparticle delivery system. Here we provide evidence of inducing an RNAi mechanism of action in a human from the delivered siRNA. Tumour biopsies from melanoma patients obtained after treatment show the presence of intracellularly localized nanoparticles in amounts that correlate with dose levels of the nanoparticles administered (this is, to our knowledge, a first for systemically delivered nanoparticles of any kind). Furthermore, a reduction was found in both the specific messenger RNA (M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2)) and the protein (RRM2) levels when compared to pre-dosing tissue. Most notably, we detect the presence of an mRNA fragment that demonstrates that siRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage occurs specifically at the site predicted for an RNAi mechanism from a patient who received the highest dose of the nanoparticles. Together, these data demonstrate that siRNA administered systemically to a human can produce a specific gene inhibition (reduction in mRNA and protein) by an RNAi mechanism of action.</abstract><notes>Davis, Mark E; Zuckerman, Jonathan E; Choi, Chung Hang J; Seligson, David; Tolcher, Anthony; Alabi, Christopher A; Yen, Yun; Heidel, Jeremy D; Ribas, Antoni; CA U54 119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119347-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Nature. 2010 Apr 15;464(7291):1067-70.

Evidence has suggested that erythropoietin (EPO) exerts cytoprotective effects on nonerythroid cells. However, the influence of EPO on pancreatic beta cells and diabetes has not been evaluated to date. In this study, we report that recombinant human EPO treatment can protect against diabetes development in streptozotocin-induced and db/db mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. EPO exerts antiapoptotic, proliferative, antiinflammatory, and angiogenic effects within the islets. Using beta-cell-specific EPO receptor and JAK2 knockout mice, we show that these effects of EPO result from direct biological effects on beta cells and that JAK2 is an essential intracellular mediator. Thus, promotion of EPO signaling in beta cells may be a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes prevention and treatment.</abstract><notes>Choi, Diana; Schroer, Stephanie A; Lu, Shun Yan; Wang, Linyuan; Wu, Xiaohong; Liu, Yunfeng; Zhang, Yi; Gaisano, Herbert Y; Wagner, Kay-Uwe; Wu, Hong; Retnakaran, Ravi; Woo, Minna; CA117930/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; MOP-201188/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada; MOP-64464/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada; J Exp Med. 2010 Dec 20;207(13):2831-42.

The effects of Tf content on nanoparticle tumor targeting were investigated in mice bearing s.c. Neuro2A tumors. Quantitative biodistributions of the nanoparticles 24 h after i.v. tail-vein injections show that the nanoparticle accumulations in the tumors and other organs are independent of Tf. However, the nanoparticle localizations within a particular organ are influenced by the Tf content. In tumor tissue, the content of targeting ligands significantly influences the number of nanoparticles localized within the cancer cells. In liver tissue, high Tf content leads to small amounts of the nanoparticles residing in hepatocytes, whereas most nanoparticles remain in nonparenchymal cells. These results suggest that targeted nanoparticles can provide greater intracellular delivery of therapeutic agents to the cancer cells within solid tumors than their nontargeted analogs.</abstract><notes>Choi, Chung Hang J; Alabi, Christopher A; Webster, Paul; Davis, Mark E; CA 119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 EB004657/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Jan 19;107(3):1235-40.

We report the development of an antibiofouling polysiloxane containing amphiphilic diblock copolymer, poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(gamma-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane) (PEO-b-PgammaMPS), for coating and functionalizing high quality hydrophobic nanocrystals such as iron oxide nanoparticles and quantum dots. These PEO-b-PgammaMPS-coated nanocrystals were colloidally stable in biological medium and showed low non-specific binding by macromolecules after incubation with 100% fetal bovine serum. Both in vitro experiments with macrophages and in vivo biodistribution studies in mice revealed that PEO-b-PgammaMPS copolymer-coated nanocrystals have an antibiofouling effect that reduces non-specific cell and RES uptake. Surface functionalization with amine groups was accomplished through co-crosslinking the polysiloxane coating layer and (3-Aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane in aqueous solution. Tumor integrin alpha(v)beta(3) targeting peptide cyclo-RGD ligands were conjugated on the nanoparticles through a heterobifunctional linker. The resulting integrin alpha(v)beta(3) targeting nanoparticle conjugates showed improved cancer cell targeting with a stronger affinity to U87MG glioma cells, which have a high expression of alpha(v)beta(3) integrins, but minimal binding to MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low expression of alpha(v)beta(3) integrins.</abstract><notes>Chen, Hongwei; Wang, Liya; Yeh, Julie; Wu, Xinying; Cao, Zehong; Wang, Yongqiang A; Zhang, Minming; Yang, Lily; Mao, Hui; P20 CA134223-010002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50 CA128301-020003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P50CA128301-01A10003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119338-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA119338-040001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; England; Biomaterials. 2010 Jul;31(20):5397-407.

This effect is commonly used to measure the concentrations of a variety of small molecules. We perform extensive Monte Carlo simulations of water diffusing around SPIO nanoparticle aggregates to determine the relationship between T2CP and details of the aggregate. We find that in the motional averaging regime T2CP scales as a power law with the number N of nanoparticles in an aggregate. The specific scaling is dependent on the fractal dimension d of the aggregates. We find T2CP proportional, variantN-0.44 for aggregates with d = 2.2, a value typical of diffusion limited aggregation. We also find that in two-nanoparticle systems, T2CP is strongly dependent on the orientation of the two nanoparticles relative to the external magnetic field, which implies that it may be possible to sense the orientation of a two-nanoparticle aggregate. To optimize the sensitivity of SPIO nanoparticle sensors, we propose that it is best to have aggregates with few nanoparticles, close together, measured with long pulse-echo times.</abstract><notes>U54 CA119349-049003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; J Magn Magn Mater. 2010 Oct 1;322(20):3122-3126.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20689678</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2913908</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jmmm.2010.05.044</electronic-resource-num><language>Eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>361</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">361</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bisht, S.</author><author>Mizuma, M.</author><author>Feldmann, G.</author><author>Ottenhof, N.

Nevertheless, the clinical translation of curcumin has been significantly hampered due to its poor systemic bioavailability, which mandates that patients consume up to 8 to 10 g of the free drug orally each day to achieve detectable levels in circulation. We have engineered a polymeric nanoparticle encapsulated curcumin formulation (NanoCurc) that shows remarkably higher systemic bioavailability in plasma and tissues compared with free curcumin upon parenteral administration. In xenograft models of human pancreatic cancer established in athymic mice, administration of parenteral NanoCurc significantly inhibits primary tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic settings. The combination of parenteral NanoCurc with gemcitabine results in enhanced tumor growth inhibition versus either single agent, suggesting an additive therapeutic influence in vivo. Furthermore, this combination completely abrogates systemic metastases in orthotopic pancreatic cancer xenograft models. Tumor growth inhibition is accompanied by significant reduction in activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, as well as significant reduction in expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and cyclin D1, in xenografts treated with NanoCurc and gemcitabine. NanoCurc is a promising new formulation that is able to overcome a major impediment for the clinical translation of curcumin to cancer patients by improving systemic bioavailability, and by extension, therapeutic efficacy.</abstract><notes>Bisht, Savita; Mizuma, Masamichi; Feldmann, Georg; Ottenhof, Niki A; Hong, Seung-Mo; Pramanik, Dipankar; Chenna, Venugopal; Karikari, Collins; Sharma, Rajni; Goggins, Michael G; Rudek, Michelle A; Ravi, Rajani; Maitra, Amarnath; Maitra, Anirban; P01 CA134292-01A18406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P01CA134292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; P30CA069773/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA113669-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01 CA113669-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA113669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; R01CA13767/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54 CA151838-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; UL1RR025005/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 Aug;9(8):2255-64.

This study is the first to evaluate the factors affecting the high interpatient variability in the pharmacokinetic disposition of S-CKD602. S-CKD602 was administered intravenously (i.v.) every 3 weeks as part of a phase I study. Pharmacokinetics studies of the liposomal encapsulated and released CKD-602 in plasma were performed. The pharmacokinetic variability of S-CKD602 is associated with both linear and nonlinear clearances. Patients &gt; or =60 years of age have a 2.7-fold higher exposure of S-CKD602 as compared with patients &lt;60 years of age (P = 0.02). Patients with a lean body composition have a higher plasma exposure of S-CKD602 (P = 0.02). Patients who have received prior therapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) have a 2.2-fold higher exposure of S-CKD602 as compared with patients who have not received PLD (P = 0.045). Prolonged exposure of the encapsulated drug in plasma over 1-2 weeks provides significant pharmacologic advantages. The high interpatient variability in the pharmacokinetic disposition of S-CKD602 was associated with age, body composition, saturable clearance, and prior PLD therapy.</abstract><notes>Zamboni, W C; Strychor, S; Maruca, L; Ramalingam, S; Zamboni, B A; Wu, H; Friedland, D M; Edwards, R P; Stoller, R G; Belani, C P; Ramanathan, R K; 5M01 RR 00056/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/; Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2009 Nov;86(5):519-26.

Many of the minimally invasive therapies that promise to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcomes heat tissue to very specific temperatures to be effective. Measurements are required because physiological cooling, primarily blood flow, makes the temperature difficult to predict a priori. The ratio of the fifth and third harmonics of the magnetization generated by magnetic nanoparticles in a sinusoidal field is used to generate a calibration curve and to subsequently estimate the temperature. The calibration curve is obtained by varying the amplitude of the sinusoidal field. The temperature can then be estimated from any subsequent measurement of the ratio. The accuracy was 0.3 degree K between 20 and 50 degrees C using the current apparatus and half-second measurements. The method is independent of nanoparticle concentration and nanoparticle size distribution.</abstract><notes>P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;U54 CA151662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States&#xD;Journal Article&#xD;United States</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=19544801 </url></related-urls></urls><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1370</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1370</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rauwerdink, A.

Previous in vitro studies have indicated that CLDN3 overexpression promotes the migration, invasion, and survival of ovarian cancer cells. Here, we investigated the efficacy of lipidoid-formulated CLDN3 siRNA in 3 different ovarian cancer models. Intratumoral injection of lipidoid/CLDN3 siRNA into OVCAR-3 xenografts resulted in dramatic silencing of CLDN3, significant reduction in cell proliferation, reduction in tumor growth, and a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells. Intraperitoneal injection of lipidoid-formulated CLDN3 siRNA resulted in a substantial reduction in tumor burden in MISIIR/TAg transgenic mice and mice bearing tumors derived from mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells. Ascites development was reduced in CLDN3 siRNA-treated mice, suggesting the treatment effectively suppressed metastasis. Toxicity was not observed after multiple i.p. injections. Importantly, treatment of mice with nonimmunostimulatory 2&apos;-OMe modified CLDN3 siRNA was as effective in suppressing tumor growth as unmodifed siRNA. These results suggest that lipidoid-formulated CLDN3 siRNA has potential as a therapeutic for ovarian cancer.</abstract><notes>Huang, Yu-Hung; Bao, Yunhua; Peng, Weidan; Goldberg, Michael; Love, Kevin; Bumcrot, David A; Cole, Geoffrey; Langer, Robert; Anderson, Daniel G; Sawicki, Janet A; CA132091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; EB00244/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Mar 3;106(9):3426-30.

This small molecule competes with 17beta-estradiol for binding to estrogen receptor, a hormone receptor upregulated in a majority of breast cancers, subsequently initiating programmed cell death. We have synthesized a thiol-PEGylated tamoxifen derivative that can be used to selectively target and deliver plasmonic gold nanoparticles to estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells with up to 2.7-fold enhanced drug potency in vitro. Optical microscopy/spectroscopy, time-dependent dose-response data, and estrogen competition studies indicate that augmented activity is due to increased rates of intracellular tamoxifen transport by nanoparticle endocytosis, rather than by passive diffusion of the free drug. Both ligand- and receptor-dependent intracellular delivery of gold nanoparticles suggest that plasma membrane localized estrogen receptor alpha may facilitate selective uptake and retention of this and other therapeutic nanoparticle conjugates. Combined targeting selectivity and enhanced potency provides opportunities for both multimodal endocrine treatment strategies and adjunctive laser photothermal therapy.</abstract><notes>Dreaden, Erik C; Mwakwari, Sandra C; Sodji, Quaovi H; Oyelere, Adegboyega K; El-Sayed, Mostafa A; U54 CA119338-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; U54CA119338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/; Bioconjug Chem. 2009 Dec;20(12):2247-53.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t; Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19919059</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>2839930</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/bc9002212</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>652</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">652</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Agnew, H.

However, there is a fundamental dearth in cellular-level understanding of how nanoparticles interact within the tumor environment in living subjects. Adopting quantum dots (qdots) for their excellent brightness, photostability, monodispersity, and fluorescent yield, we link arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptides to target qdots specifically to newly formed/forming blood vessels expressing alpha vbeta 3 integrins. Using this model nanoparticle system, we exploit intravital microscopy with subcellular ( approximately 0.5 microm) resolution to directly observe and record, for the first time, the binding of nanoparticle conjugates to tumor blood vessels in living subjects. This generalizable method enabled us to show that in this model qdots do not extravasate and, unexpectedly, that they only bind as aggregates rather than individually. This level of understanding is critical on the path toward ensuring regulatory approval of nanoparticles in humans for disease diagnostics and therapeutics. Equally vital, the work provides a platform by which to design and optimize molecularly targeted nanoparticles including quantum dots for applications in living subjects.</abstract><notes>Smith, Bryan Ronain&#xD;Cheng, Zhen&#xD;De, Abhijit&#xD;Koh, Ai Leen&#xD;Sinclair, Robert&#xD;Gambhir, Sanjiv Sam&#xD;P50 CA114747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA119367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Nano Lett. 2008 Sep;8(9):2599-606.

The sensor achieves high sensitivity and a limit of detection of 100 pM by monitoring the SERRS signal change upon the single-step of thrombin binding to immobilized thrombin binding aptamer. The selectivity of the sensor is demonstrated by the specific discrimination of thrombin from other protein analytes. The specific recognition and binding of thrombin by the thrombin binding aptamer is essential to the mechanism of the aptamer-based sensor, as shown through measurements using negative control oligonucleotides. In addition, the sensor can detect 1 nM thrombin in the presence of complex biofluids, such as 10% fetal calf serum, demonstrating that the immobilized, 5&apos;-capped, 3&apos;-capped aptamer is sufficiently robust for clinical diagnostic applications. Furthermore, the proposed sensor may be implemented for multiplexed detection using different aptamer-Raman probe complexes.</abstract><notes>Cho, Hansang&#xD;Baker, Brian R&#xD;Wachsmann-Hogiu, Sebastian&#xD;Pagba, Cynthia V&#xD;Laurence, Ted A&#xD;Lane, Stephen M&#xD;Lee, Luke P&#xD;Tok, Jeffrey B H&#xD;AI065359/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/&#xD;U54 CA151459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/&#xD;Nano Lett. 2008 Dec;8(12):4386-90. doi: 10.1021/nl802245w.</notes><work-type>Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov&apos;t&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov&apos;t, Non-P.H.S.</work-type><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19367849</url></related-urls></urls><custom2>3477626</custom2><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/nl802245w</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>752</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">752</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Akinc, A.</author><author>Zumbuehl, A.</author><author>Goldberg, M.</author><author>Leshchiner, E.

The diversity of current delivery materials remains limited, in part because of their slow, multi-step syntheses. Here we describe a new class of lipid-like delivery molecules, termed lipidoids, as delivery agents for RNAi therapeutics. Chemical methods were developed to allow the rapid synthesis of a large library of over 1,200 structurally diverse lipidoids. From this library, we identified lipidoids that facilitate high levels of specific silencing of endogenous gene transcripts when formulated with either double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) or single-stranded antisense 2&apos;-O-methyl (2&apos;-OMe) oligoribonucleotides targeting microRNA (miRNA). The safety and efficacy of lipidoids were evaluated in three animal models: mice, rats and nonhuman primates. The studies reported here suggest that these materials may have broad utility for both local and systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics.</abstract><notes>Akinc, Akin; Zumbuehl, Andreas; Goldberg, Michael; Leshchiner, Elizaveta S; Busini, Valentina; Hossain, Naushad; Bacallado, Sergio A; Nguyen, David N; Fuller, Jason; Alvarez, Rene; Borodovsky, Anna; Borland, Todd; Constien, Rainer; de Fougerolles, Antonin; Dorkin, J Robert; Narayanannair Jayaprakash, K; Jayaraman, Muthusamy; John, Matthias; Koteliansky, Victor; Manoharan, Muthiah; Nechev, Lubomir; Qin, June; Racie, Timothy; Raitcheva, Denitza; Rajeev, Kallanthottathil G; Sah, Dinah W Y; Soutschek, Jurgen; Toudjarska, Ivanka; Vornlocher, Hans-Peter; Zimmermann, Tracy S; Langer, Robert; Anderson, Daniel G; R01 EB000244-27/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; R01 EB00244/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/; Nat Biotechnol. 2008 May;26(5):561-9.

By establishing a rat ischemic hind limb model, the effects of ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene transfection to skeletal muscles were also studied in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultrasound irradiation was applied on the mixture of microbubbles and GFP plasmid in vitro. Gel electrophoresis was used to detect the effects of ultrasound and microbubbles on GFP plasmid. For in vivo experiments, ultrasound irradiation was applied on the hind limb after directly injecting microbubbles into the hind limb of Wistar rats. Directly after treatment, the skeletal muscles were harvested to observe the microstructure. We also studied the transfer rate of GFP plasmid DNA into the skeletal muscles of rats by applying ultrasound and microbubble technique. Furthermore, a naked VEGF plasmid was applied to study the feasibility of angiogenesis by using rats ischemia models. RESULTS: Gel electrophoresis of plasmid DNA showed that there was no difference between the groups. By studying the hematoxylin and eosin stained pictures of the skeletal muscles, we found that ultrasound irradiation of skeletal muscle after injection of microbubbles could cause the exudation of the red blood cells, whereas it had no effects on the microstructure of muscle fibers. In vivo experiments showed that an ultrasound microbubble could enhance the transfer of plasmid DNA to the skeletal muscles. CONCLUSIONS: The ultrasound-mediated microbubble technique provides an effective noninvasive method for gene therapy.</abstract><notes>Zhang, Qunxia&#xD;Wang, Zhigang&#xD;Ran, Haitao&#xD;Fu, Xinping&#xD;Li, Xiaodong&#xD;Zheng, Yuanyi&#xD;Peng, Mingli&#xD;Chen, Min&#xD;Schutt, Carolyn E&#xD;Acad Radiol. 2006 Mar;13(3):363-7.</notes><urls><related-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16488849</url></related-urls></urls><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.acra.2005.11.003</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="Round 2 publications.enl" path="C:\downloads\Round 2 publications.enl">Round 2 publications.enl</database><source-app name="EndNote" version="17.0">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>1335</rec-number><foreign-keys><key app="EN" db-id="0e0ee20tl9f50te0zeoxeaxnps5s0xd9dz5e">1335</key></foreign-keys><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singh, A.</author><author>Iyer, A.
