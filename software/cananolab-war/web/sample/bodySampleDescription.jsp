		This is the manage samples section which allows users to enter general
		information about the sample, detailed information about the
		composition of the sample, and information about the physico-chemical,
		<i>in vitro</i>, and other characterizations performed on the sample. A
		sample is a formulation of a base nanomaterial platform and any
		additional components that contribute to the function(s) of the
		nanomaterial. A sample can also be a control used in comparative
		analysis. In this section, depending on your authorization level, you
		may submit new sample information or search for an existing sample for
		editing, copying, viewing, printing, or exporting.
