Welcome to the caNanoLab Project!
=====================================

Welcome to the cancer Nanotechnology Laboratory (caNanoLab) portal. caNanoLab is a data sharing portal designed to facilitate information sharing across the international biomedical nanotechnology research community to expedite and validate the use of nanotechnology in biomedicine. caNanoLab provides support for the annotation of nanomaterials with characterizations resulting from physico-chemical, in vitro and in vivo assays and the sharing of these characterizations and associated nanotechnology protocols in a secure fashion.
