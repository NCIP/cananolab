Assumptions
-----------
The current installation assumes you're running on a 'clean' Windows machine. The MySQL default password is curently used (<blank>).

There are two primary steps to getting the installation to work. The first is creating the installation and the second is running the installation. 

1. To create the installation, open a command prompt from your location directory that represents http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/svnroot/caarray2/trunk/tools/installer and type ant selfextract

2. From the same directory, type ant install (assuming you've already extracted the file)
